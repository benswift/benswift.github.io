**Note**: the canonical version of this page is the web version hosted at <{{
page.url | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}>. If you're able to then
I recommend you check it out; it's got
[hyperlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink), [reflowable
text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflowable_document) so that it's readable
on mobile, it's accessible to [screen
readers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader) and other assistive
technologies, and it's always up-to-date. Unless, of course, you're reading this
pre-1989, in which case the [web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web)
hasn't been invented, and I guess you should just print it out & read it on
paper. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!
