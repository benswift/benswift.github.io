This was a really nice gig---the final gig of the day as part of the
[You Are Here (YAH) festival program](https://issuu.com/newbestfriend/docs/yah_program2014_issuu).
The screen was projected onto a bedsheet hanging from the wall, and I think some
folks were even there in their pyjamas. As a result, I went for a "downtempo
glitch" vibe. Here are a couple of photos, no videos have turned up (sadly).

and for the video...

...sorry about that.
