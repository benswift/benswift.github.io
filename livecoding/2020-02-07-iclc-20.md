It was great to be selected to perform at the
[International Conference on Live Coding (ICLC)](https://iclc.toplap.org/2020/schedule.html)
[Algorave](https://algorave.com/about/) this year (program notes). I performed a
from-scratch livecoded music set in
[Extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore), with
[Giovanni Muzio (kesson)](https://kesson.io) doing livecoded visuals in
Processing/OpenGL.

The ICLC'20 algorave live stream video is above. There were some issues with the
stream, so the first bit of our set was cut off, but you can see the second half
of it from around the 2h16m mark.
