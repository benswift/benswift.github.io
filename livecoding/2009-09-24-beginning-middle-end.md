Here is the video of my set at the _Beginning Middle End_ festival.
Unfortunately the audio's pretty bad---we didn't take a direct line out of the
desk. And as you can see, there's a star turn from the back of someone's head.

This was an **interactive** live coding concert; there were some iPhones and

could be used to influence certain aspects of the music.

Here's a photo of me preparing for the gig:

and a couple more shots from the gig (in the School of Art Gallery).
