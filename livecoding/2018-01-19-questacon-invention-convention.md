The
[National Invention Convention](https://www.questacon.edu.au/outreach/programmes/questacon-smart-skills-initiative/questacon-invention-convention#term1569)
is an all-expenses paid, five day workshop at Questacon in Canberra, held every
January. This program gives 25 delegates aged 14-18 from all around Australia
the opportunity to play, make and create with us, designing and developing a
prototype that relates to a theme we give them.

At the end of every event there's both a formal awards ceremony and a dance
party for the participants to let their hair down. In 2018 I was the headline
act at the latter 😊

Alas, no video survives. But many shapes were pulled by the participants.
