As per the
[Art, Not Apart website](https://artnotapart.com/artist/2014/beats-from-bits/)

> Livecoding: it’s programming as performance—beats from bits. See music and
> visuals made with code, right in front of your eyes. Everything you can see
> and hear is programmed live by Ben Swift and Torben Sko using their own custom
> software. No canned loops; only the freshest locally produced sustainable
> organic hipster vegan beats for your enjoyment.

This gig was my first livecoding collaboration with media artist
[Torben Sko](https://torbensko.com/). No full video survives---just the
following short fragment of the _very start_ of the performance. Torb isn't in
shot, but he's making the colours change on the screen.
