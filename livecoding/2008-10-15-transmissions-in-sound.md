# Transmissions in Sound

<p class="post-date">15 Oct 2008</p>

**Venue:** [ANU School of Music, Canberra](https://music.cass.anu.edu.au/) |
**Type:** curated | **Curators:** Luke Penders | **Artists:** Ben Swift

My first proper curated livecoding gig, way back in 2008. No photos or videos
survive, but I can _vaguely_ remember it. I was super-nervous.
