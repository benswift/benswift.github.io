  abstract = {User interfaces for source code editing are a crucial component in any software development environment, and in many editors visual annotations (overlaid on the textual source code) are used to provide important contextual information to the programmer. This paper focuses on the real-time programming activity of `cyberphysical' programming, and considers the type of visual annotations which may be helpful in this programming context.},

  abstract = {The ten-year anniversary of TOPLAP presents a unique opportunity for reflection and introspection. In this essay we ask the question, what is the meaning of live coding? Our goal is not to answer this question, in absolute terms, but rather to attempt to unpack some of live coding's many meanings. Our hope is that by exploring some of the formal, embodied, and cultural meanings surrounding live-coding practice, we may help to stimulate a conversation that will resonate within the live-coding community for the next ten years.},
