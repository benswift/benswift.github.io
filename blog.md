This is my blog. Sometimes in these posts I'll talk about research or art
projects I'm involved with, although I also blog about my research on the [c/c/c
blog](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/news/). Sometimes I'll just
ramble about other stuff which is keeping me up at night. If you're interested
on blog posts only on a certain topic, there's a [tags index]({%
link blog-tag-index.md %}).

If anything here sparks your interest (or your ire!) then get in touch
([twitter](https://twitter.com/benswift), [email](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au))
or discuss on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com).
