have noticed that I‚Äôve recently become the <a href="https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/people/ben-swift/">lead of the <em>Experiences</em>
Team</a> at the School of
Cybernetics. My team‚Äôs mission is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>to take Cybernetics to the world by providing encounters with cybernetics to
individuals and organisations who are (currently) not in our Masters/PhD
programs.</p>

  <p>‚Ä¶and to find ways to do it sustainably.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/alina-grubnyak-ZiQkhI7417A-unsplash.jpg" alt="a bunch of wires connected together in interesting geometric shapes" /></p>

<p>That might strike you as a pretty broad mission, for a couple of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what counts as an <em>encounter</em>? couldn‚Äôt that be anything?</li>
  <li>the world is a big and diverse place</li>
</ul>

<p>‚Ä¶and you‚Äôd be right. If you follow the rest of the communications from the
School of Cybernetics you‚Äôll know that we‚Äôre not shy about painting a grand,
totalising vision of how the world can/might work and what part cybernetics has
to play in it. And while I‚Äôm a bit daunted by the task, I‚Äôm also pretty excited.</p>

<p>Here are some of the things my team will be working on over the next weeks/months/years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>site-specific experiences based around specific places; uncovering the
cybernetic histories of some of the places we inhabit on the ANU campus and
beyond, and creating narrative experiences to share those histories with
others</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>articulating many different answers to the question ‚Äúwhat is cybernetics?‚Äù for
different audiences &amp; mediums (online/in-person, talks/workshops/happenings,
prosaic/poetic)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>creating a curriculum for interested partners to understand how the key ideas
of cybernetics can help them untagle (or at least manage) the complexity in
their businesses and other organisations</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What I can say is that I want the things we make to be <strong>weird</strong>. If I ever turn
up in a tie and a blue suit and deliver an hours-long bullet-pointed PowerPoint
presentation<sup id="fnref:ppt" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ppt" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> on this stuff then you have my permission to point me back to
this post and ask me where it all went wrong. Otherwise, I look forward to
crossing paths with you and sharing an educational experience about cybernetics.</p>

      <p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, PowerPoint (well, visual aids in general) can be super

managed via <a href="https://sylabs.io/singularity/">SingularityCE</a>, whose homepage
boldly asks and then forgets to answer the question: ‚ÄúWhat is SingularityCE?‚Äù</p>

<p>If you <a href="https://sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/introduction.html">dig further into the
documentation</a>
it‚Äôs a little less coy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SingularityCE is a container platform. It allows you to create and run
containers that package up pieces of software in a way that is portable and
reproducible. You can build a container using SingularityCE on your laptop,
and then run it on many of the largest HPC clusters in the world, local
university or company clusters, a single server, in the cloud, or on a
workstation down the hall. Your container is a single file, and you don‚Äôt have
to worry about how to install all the software you need on each different
operating system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to fire up my new GPUs and run one of Katherine Crowson‚Äôs awesome pytorch
scripts to do some <a href="https://github.com/crowsonkb/style-transfer-pytorch">neural style
transfer</a>. I‚Äôm very
familiar with Docker, but new to this Singularity thing, so here are some of the
hurdles I encountered (and cleared) along the way.</p>

<h2 id="finding-a-base-image">Finding a base image</h2>

<p>Looking in the style transfer repo‚Äôs
<a href="https://github.com/crowsonkb/style-transfer-pytorch/blob/master/setup.py#L23"><code>setup.py</code></a>,
it looks like <a href="https://pytorch.org">torch</a> v1.7.1 or later is required. Having
done this sort of thing before, I know that these deep learning frameworks
change a fair bit even between minor versions, so the safest option is to pick
the exact version that it was designed for‚Äîin this case v1.7.1 (or at least
v1.7.x).</p>

<p>So, the challenge is to find a Singularity image with that version of torch
installed. The singularity docs <a href="https://sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/quick_start.html#download-pre-built-images">suggest using the search
command</a>
like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">$ singularity search torch

</code></pre>

<p>Hmm. It‚Äôs hard to know which is official, which ones are going to work (a few of
them mention torch versions, but none of them are v1.7.x) and which ones might
even be malicious? That‚Äôs a worry.</p>

<p>Looking a bit deeper into the Singularity docs I find that one can <a href="https://sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/singularity_and_docker.html">also use
Docker/OCI
images</a>,
and Singularity can pull them straight from Docker hub. That‚Äôs good news,
because NVIDIA do maintain <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/pytorch/pytorch/tags">official Docker
images</a> for using torch with
NVIDIA graphics cards (like the 3090), so I find the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/layers/pytorch/pytorch/1.7.1-cuda11.0-cudnn8-runtime/images/sha256-db6086be92f439b918c96dc002f4cf40239e247f0b1b6c32e3fb36de70032bf9?context=explore">specific container image
for torch
v1.7.1</a>
and pull it down with:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">singularity pull docker://pytorch/pytorch:1.7.1-cuda11.0-cudnn8-runtime
</code></pre>

<h2 id="running-the-style_transfer-python-script">Running the <code>style_transfer</code> python script</h2>

<p>I‚Äôd already cloned the neural style transfer repo, so I can follow the
instructions in that
<a href="https://github.com/crowsonkb/style-transfer-pytorch/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a></p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">$ singularity shell pytorch_1.7.0-cuda11.0-cudnn8-runtime.sif 
Singularity&gt; cd style-transfer-pytorch/
Singularity&gt; pip install --user .
</code></pre>

<p>I got a bunch of warnings about certain things not being on the <code>$PATH</code>, but it
seems to finish installing everthing ok.</p>

<p>Continuing on with the instructions in the README, let‚Äôs try running this thing
(I‚Äôd downloaded a couple of image files to use as my <em>content</em> and <em>style</em> images).</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">Singularity&gt; style_transfer ben.jpg tiger.jpg -o ben-tiger.jpg
bash: style_transfer: command not found
</code></pre>

<p>Hmm, looks like those <code>$PATH</code> warnings were prescient. Looking back, the exact
warning was:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">WARNING: The script normalizer is installed in '/home/users/ben/.local/bin' which is not on PATH
</code></pre>

<p>The quickest &amp; dirtiest fix for this is to add that <code>/bin</code> directory to my path
and try and re-run the script.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">Singularity&gt; PATH="$PATH:~/.local/bin" style_transfer ben.jpg tiger.jpg -o ben-tiger.jpg
</code></pre>

<p>And away it went! Several minutes later, it was done. Here are the original two images:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/headshots/headshot.jpg" alt="Original ben.jpg image" />
<img src="/assets/images/posts/tiger.jpg" alt="Original tiger.jpg" /></p>

<p>and here‚Äôs the output:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/ben-tiger.jpg" alt="style-transferred ben-tiger.jpg" /></p>

<p>Success‚Ä¶ish. Clearly I need to keep tweaking parameters &amp; input images to come
up with an output that‚Äôs actually <em>good</em>, but at least that journey can now
begin.</p>

<h2 id="but-is-it-fast">But is it <em>fast</em>?</h2>

<p>Actually, that declaration of success is a bit premature. At the top of the
output I noticed that the script was running on the CPU, not the GPU.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">Singularity&gt; PATH="$PATH:~/.local/bin" style_transfer ben.jpg tiger.jpg -o ben-tiger.jpg

</code></pre>

<p>That‚Äôs really not ok‚Äîthe whole point of running on this machine is to take
advantage of the GPUs. There could be lots of reasons for this, but I have a
hunch it has something to do with Singularity not allowing the script access to
the hardware. Sure enough, looking through the <a href="https://sylabs.io/guides/3.7/user-guide/gpu.html">Singularity GPU support
documentation</a> it turns out
there‚Äôs a magic <code>--nv</code> flag which must be passed when starting up the
Singularity session, so let‚Äôs do that.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">$ singularity shell --nv pytorch_1.7.1-cuda11.0-cudnn8-runtime.sif

</code></pre>

<p>Well, that‚Äôs progress. Looking through the output I can see</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">Using devices: cuda:0

<p>so torch can now see the GPUs. However, the error message in the middle of that
output is now the problem:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Like I said earlier, torch/tensorflow/CUDA and deep learning frameworks in
general are really finnicky about versions. It‚Äôs tricky to get things up and
running so that (i) all the versions work together and (ii) the changes you make
don‚Äôt break the delicate version relationships between other deep learning
projects you want to run on the same system<sup id="fnref:singularity-isolation" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:singularity-isolation" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>After a web search, it seems <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/4886">like others
</a> <a href="https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/geforce-rtx-3090-with-cuda-capability-sm-86-is-not-compatible-with-the-current-pytorch-installation/123499">have

<a href="https://github.com/crowsonkb/style-transfer-pytorch/issues/1#issuecomment-769701949">similar
issues</a>,
although I tried all the approaches listed there and none of them worked.</p>

<h2 id="using-a-pytorch-image-from-nvidias-container-registry">Using a pytorch image from NVIDIA‚Äôs container registry</h2>

<p>Changing tack a bit (after a suggestion from a colleague) I decided to try using
a (Docker) <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch">container image from the NVIDIA
registry</a>, rather
than the official pytorch channel on Docker Hub.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">$ singularity pull docker://nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:22.01-py3
$ singularity shell --nv pytorch_22.01-py3.sif 
Singularity&gt; pip install --user .
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let‚Äôs try running the <code>style_trasfer</code> script one more time:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">Singularity&gt; PATH="$PATH:~/.local/bin" style_transfer ben.jpg tiger.jpg -o ben-tiger.jpg
Using devices: cuda:0
GPU 0 type: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 (compute 8.6)
GPU 0 RAM: 24268 MB

Processing content image (128x85)...
</code></pre>

<p>Hooray! It works, and runs, like 10000x faster on the GPU.</p>

<h2 id="open-questions">Open questions</h2>

<p>I really was just ‚Äúhacking it until it worked‚Äù during this process, so I have a
few open questions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What‚Äôs the ‚Äúpersistance‚Äù story with the singularity images (<code>*.sif</code> files)? Is
it like docker, where I <code>singularity shell</code> in, do some things, but then any
changes I make in the shell (container?) don‚Äôt persist? It doesn‚Äôt seem like
that‚Ä¶ but need to have a better mental model of how singularity images work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I didn‚Äôt use <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">venvs</a> or
<a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/">conda</a> or
<a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/">poetry</a> or any of the things I‚Äôd usually use
when python-ing on my own machine, partially because of my above questions
about how the whole singularity shell thing actually works. I just did <code>pip
install --user .</code> and hoped it didn‚Äôt break anything else. Is that ok? Or
should I still use venvs in the singularity image?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I will return and try and better understand these things later, but right now
this isn‚Äôt on the critical path for me so I‚Äôll have to park it. This blog post
is really just me opening a ticket for myself to return to later. I share it so
that you, dear reader, can also benefit from my mistakes (and if you know of
better ways to do any of this then do <a href="mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au">drop me a

&amp; procedures for futuring. This post is an attempt to get my head around how
these things fit together (spoiler: they do!).</p>

<h2 id="futures">Futures</h2>

<p>Futures/futuring<sup id="fnref:terminology" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:terminology" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> is <em>a thing</em>‚Äîsee <a href="https://www.howtofuture.com">Smith and
Ashby</a> for a practical guide or
<a href="https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=p084690">Powers</a> for a more critical
history and review. It‚Äôs the idea and practice of futuring as a verb, and this
video from the <a href="https://www.iftf.org">Institute for the Future</a> is a good
articulation of the ‚Äúpitch‚Äù:</p>

<div style="width:100%; margin: 0px auto; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
  <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0px;">
	<iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5_EsLu4qydw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="">
	</iframe>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Just so I‚Äôm clear up-front: I think that futuring is a genuinely useful tool in
the toolbelt of any individual or organisation trying to figure out what success
looks like and how to achieve it.</p>

<p>One diagram which is often used in futuring is the <a href="https://thevoroscope.com/publications/foresight-primer/">futures
cone</a>, which helps
visualise the relationship between the <em>now</em> and the different potential
<em>futures</em> which might eventuate.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/cybernetic-futures/futures-cone.png" alt="The futures cone" /></p>

<p>This diagram is just a visual aid‚Äîthe future doesn‚Äôt really exist as a series
of concentric discs of soothing colours‚Äîbut it helps to anchor discussions we
might have and predictions we might make about the future. In this sense, any
prediction or ‚Äúvision‚Äù of the future is a single <strong>point</strong> in the futures cone,
and exactly where it falls in the space of possible, plausible, probable, or
preferable futures is part of the discussion. Think about it as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">monte
carlo</a> of the future:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/cybernetic-futures/futures-sampling.png" alt="An example distribution of potential futures in the futures cone" /></p>

<p>One thing to note here is that futuring is not about predicting the future. In
many ways it makes one less certain about the future; futuring requires a
healthy dose of epistemic humility, but that‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs hard to expect the
unexpected and predict the unpredictable, so these sampled points (potential
futures) are really just a way of thinking about the current state of the world,
and especially how we might act and position ourselves in the world now to make
the most of future opportunities and steer towards the more desirable potential
futures.</p>

<h2 id="cybernetics">Cybernetics</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer">Stafford Beer</a> tells a joke about
defining cybernetics in <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/03684920210417283/">an address he gave at the University of
Valladolid</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Ä¶it concerns three men who are about to be executed. The prison governor
calls them to his office, and explains that each will be granted a last
request. The first one confesses that he has led a sinful life, and would like
to see a priest. The governor says he thinks he can arrange that. And the
second man? The second man explains that he is a professor of cybernetics. His
last request is to deliver a final and definitive answer to the question: what
is cybernetics? The governor accedes to this request also. And the third man?
Well, he is a doctoral student of the professor‚Äîhis request is to be
executed second.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It‚Äôs a great joke, grounded in a deep truth. One way to define cybernetic
systems is as systems with (i) a purpose/goal and (ii) a mechanism for steering
towards<sup id="fnref:towards" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:towards" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> said purpose. In some cases there‚Äôs a defined end state, where
upon attaining said purpose victory is declared and the job is done. However in
many cases what‚Äôs desirable is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis">homeostasis</a>, i.e. a system which
can keep itself ‚Äúin its happy place‚Äù, stable and resistant to peturbations.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/cybernetic-futures/evgeni-tcherkasski-SHA85I0G8K4-unsplash.jpg" alt="A lighthouse on the shore" /></p>

<p>There are lots of potential illustrations of this idea, but one that many of my
cybernetic forebears liked is the one of using a lighthouse to steer a ship.
<a href="https://history-computer.com/the-complete-guide-to-cybernetics/">Here‚Äôs</a> a nice
explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In ancient Greece, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics#Etymology"><em>Kubernetes</em></a>
[navigator/helmsperson] was in charge of controlling the Grecian longships.
The ships had to be steered through all kinds of unpredictable forces,
including wind, waves, storms, currents, and tides. The Greeks found that they
could ignore all of these and control the ship via a small tiller connected to
the ship‚Äôs larger rudder just by pointing the tiller toward a fixed object in
the distance, such as a lighthouse, and making adjustments in real-time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There‚Äôs a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXmlbd86YGA">YouTube ‚ÄúWhat is
cybernetics?‚Äù</a> video which includes
a diagram like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/cybernetic-futures/kubernetes-steering-procedure.png" alt="Diagram of the kubernetes' steering procedure" /></p>

<p>It‚Äôs not the particular position of the tiller at any one time that‚Äôs important,
is the way that the navigator watches the lighthouse and moves the tiller in
response (as the ship is affected by currents &amp; winds). If the ship‚Äôs bow is
pointing to one side of the lighthouse, then adjust the tiller in the opposite
direction until it does. If you keep up that simple procedure, you‚Äôll get there
in the end, and with your ship in one piece.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs the navigator‚Äôs continued monitoring of the difference between the
purpose/goal (as indicated by the lighthouse) and the current state (as
indicated by the where the bow is pointing) which matters. Once you know how to
respond to that difference, by steering in the opposite direction of that
difference, then you‚Äôve got a simple and reliable procedure for successful
sailing.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the key point: cybernetic systems don‚Äôt work by planning out a complex,
go-to-whoa list of actions to take and then mindlessly following them. Instead
they use a simpler process involving <em>feedback</em>: do a thing,
looking/listening/sense what happened, compare the new state of the world with
the goal, and then do another thing‚Ä¶ and so on<sup id="fnref:all-encompassing" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:all-encompassing" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/cybernetic-futures/remy-gieling-n_QECf2Qm4E-unsplash.jpg" alt="A radar dish" /></p>

<p>Here‚Äôs another example of a feedback-powered system. The development of radar in
WWII was deeply connected to the birth of cybernetics (as detailed by Thomas Rid
in <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/Rise-of-the-Machines/">Rise of the Machines</a>
Chapter 1). Take it away, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A radar system consists of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmitter" title="Transmitter">transmitter</a>
producing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_wave" title="Electromagnetic
wave">electromagnetic
waves</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum" title="Radio
spectrum">radio</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave" title="Microwave">microwaves</a> domain, a transmitting
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(radio)" title="Antenna (radio)">antenna</a>, a
receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and
receiving) and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_receiver" title="Radio receiver">receiver</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing_system" title="Data
processing system">processor</a> to determine properties of the object(s). Radio waves
(pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the object and return
to the receiver, giving information about the object‚Äôs location and speed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The radar sends out the pulses, which bounce (reflect) off the environment‚Äîand
these these reflections are sufficient (with some <a href="https://nato-us.org/analysis2000/papers/moran.pdf">tricky
maths</a>) to figure out what
the environment looks like. Often there‚Äôs some sort of visual representation of
the results, like the classic ‚Äúbeeping dots on concentric circles‚Äù radar sweep
interface you‚Äôll know from the movies.</p>

<p>The radar example is different from the ship steering one in that lighthouses
don‚Äôt really move/change (although the currents in the water &amp; other
environmental factors do‚Ä¶ hence the need for the feedback-powered steering
procedure). Using the radar properly requires sending an ongoing series of
pulses, because they each give an indication of what the environment looked like
when the pulses were reflected, but to track moving objects you need to monitor
the dots over time to see how the environment changes.</p>

<h2 id="cybernetic-futures">Cybernetic futures</h2>

<p>Returning to futuring; each future scenario you can imagine (regardless of where
it falls in the futures cone) is a way of projecting a potential ‚Äúend state‚Äù.
That end state doesn‚Äôt have to be desirable‚Äîmany potential futures
aren‚Äôt‚Äîbut it gives a ‚Äúconcrete‚Äù thing against which to compare your current
state to inform your current actions. Even the more mundane acts of management
and oversight‚Äîstrategy, tactics, contingency planning‚Äîwhen done well they
all involve articulating goals and thinking about ways to bring them about.
There‚Äôs clearly an echo of the ‚Äústeering systems‚Äù thing here.</p>

<p>However, one pitfall of that sort of mental picture of the future is that
futuring looks like a three step process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>come up with (sample) a bunch of potential futures from the futures cone (the
points in the diagram above)</li>
  <li>pick one of the potential futures you like the most (from the <em>preferable</em>
area of the futures cone)</li>
  <li>steer towards<sup id="fnref:lighthouse-steering" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:lighthouse-steering" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> it like a lighthouse (whatever that looks
like)</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/cybernetic-futures/steering-towards-preferred-future.png" alt="Steering towards a preferred future" /></p>

<p>That‚Äôs an unhelpful picture of what futuring is because it implies that the
potential future you‚Äôre steering towards is solid &amp; stationary, but that‚Äôs just
not how potential futures work. Instead, I think that futuring works best when
it‚Äôs more like a radar:</p>

<ol>
  <li>come up with (sample) a bunch of potential futures from the futures cone
(send out radar pulses)</li>
  <li>look for their reflections in the present</li>
  <li>analyse these reflections to decide how to act</li>
  <li>goto step 1 (because things have now changed)</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/cybernetic-futures/futures-as-radar.png" alt="Futuring as a radar" /></p>

<p>As well as giving a different mental model of what futuring is and isn‚Äôt, I
think there are two implications of this switch in perspective.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Just like a ship drifts on the currents, our orientation to these potential
futures is constantly changing as we &amp; others act in the present‚Äîwe‚Äôre
agents; we have agency. So we need to constantly re-examine our orientation
towards these multiple futures and reorient ourselves as a result. That‚Äôs a
‚Äúradar-like‚Äù model of futuring. Cybernetics doesn‚Äôt provide a ‚Äúonce you
measure &amp; model all the things you can predict the future‚Äù silver bullet
(although it‚Äôs not like some folks haven‚Äôt tried <a href="https://eujournalfuturesresearch.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s40309-013-0029-y">and
failed</a>),
but rather it‚Äôs a commitment to using a simple ‚Äúsense-analyze-act‚Äù feedback
loop to keep the system on track.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don‚Äôt be fooled by the simplicity of the steering procedure in the
ship/lighthouse example; the radar example shows that making sense of the
feedback from the environment can require non-trivial analysis before it‚Äôs
useful.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To close, I want to stress that I‚Äôm not saying anything remotely new here about
the connection between futuring and cybernetics‚Äîthey‚Äôre very often seen &amp;
discussed together. William Gibson, award-winning sci-fi novelist and sometime
futurist was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/magazine/19wwln-q4-t.html">steeped in cybernetic
lore</a> when he
<a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/08/26/how-william-gibson-coined-cyberspace/">coined the term
‚Äúcyberspace‚Äù</a>.
My boss <a href="https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/people/genevieve-bell/">Genevieve Bell
AO</a>, director of the <a href="https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au">ANU
School of Cybernetics</a>, has thought deeply and
written persuasively and generally projected big futuring energy for pretty much
her whole career.</p>

  <p>Here in the <a href="https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/">School of Cybernetics</a> we are building our
capability in cybernetics‚Äîits histories and possibilities‚Äîand
working out how each of us will contribute to the new cybernetics for the 21st
Century.</p>

  <p>This blog post, written for a general audience, is part of a content development
sprint, written in reponse to the task of developing a short (1000 words)
persuasive argument about the role and value of cybernetics as an approach to
shape futures through and with technology.</p>

</div>

<p>If you follow this blog, you‚Äôll know that I‚Äôm a <a href="/livecoding/index.html">livecoder</a>. I <em>code</em> (i.e. write computer programs) to make music in a
club setting, with an audience that just wants to dance and have a good
time<sup id="fnref:niche" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:niche" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Between the code, the thumping music, the dancing humans, and all
the other glorious complexities of live entertainment, there‚Äôs certainly a lot
of different stuff going on. You might find watching a livecoder in action to be
entertaining, or impressive, or bewildering, or all of the above. Most of all,
when you see/attend a livecoding gig for the first time, I bet that your initial
feeling is one of <em>what is going on?</em></p>

<p>In this post I‚Äôm going to use some ideas from cybernetics to try and help you
make sense of a livecoder performing in a club, in part to help you understand
for what it <em>feels like</em> I‚Äôm doing when I do it. From there I want to think
about ways to make livecoding even better, that is, to figure out put on a
better show for the adoring crowds.</p>

<h2 id="livecoder-in-the-club-as-a-system">Livecoder-in-the-club as a system</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx79HLLboT8">Cybernetics</a> is all about the
looking at and reasoning about <strong>systems</strong> with <em>goals</em>, interacting with and
connected to their <em>environment</em> via perception/action <em>feedback loops</em>. These
sorts of systems exist at all sorts of different scales (big/small, fast/slow,
old/new, cheap/expensive, etc.) and they‚Äôre <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10698938-the-fractal-organization">fractal in
nature</a>‚Äîit
doesn‚Äôt matter what level of ‚Äúmagnification‚Äù you look at, each component of a
system is itself a system of interacting components, and each system is itself a
component interacting in a larger system. But since that‚Äôs all pretty abstract,
let‚Äôs return to the example of the livecoder-in-the-club. This is written in the
first person, but other livecoders may have similar understandings of their own
livecoder-in-the-club practice.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I start with a full tank of <strong>brain juice</strong> which allows me to work on tricky
coding problems. But it‚Äôs mentally taxing. When I‚Äôm happy, rested &amp; in the
zone, I feel like I‚Äôve got a full tank, but writing code takes mental energy,
and so writing the code in the performance drains my brain juice until I‚Äôm
cooked, and then I can‚Äôt write any more code (or at least will write bad/buggy
code) until I recharge.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To write the <strong>code</strong> I tap my fingers on the keys of my keyboard. I use a
<a href="https://emacs.sexy">specialised program</a> for this (i.e. I don‚Äôt write it in
MS Word) which has a bunch of features to help, like different colours for the
different parts of the code (e.g. functions vs variable vs numerical parameter
values), and auto-completion, and inline documentation/help about the
particular bit of code that I‚Äôm working on. This code is also projected onto a
big screen in the club so that the dancers can look at it (or not).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the code runs, it generates <strong>music</strong>. Different parts of the code are
responsible for different parts of the music, and I try and give the functions
&amp; variables in my code human-readable names (like <code>piano</code>) so that the
correspondence between the code and the music is clear-ish. The music will
only be generated if the code is running nicely (i.e. without bugs/errors) and
is hooked up to the PA system in the club. If I crash the program (or if
someone unplugs the PA) then the music will stop.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people in the club‚Äîpeople dancing, people chilling at the bar, people
watching the code on the screen‚Äîare collectively having an experience which
(hopefully) is giving them <strong>good vibes</strong>. Obviously this is a <em>huge</em>
oversimplification, and the extent to which any individual is enjoying
themselves (and therefore contributing positively to the amount of good vibes
in the room) depends on all sorts of things. But, in a real sense, the
creation of <strong>good vibes</strong> in the room is the goal of the live coder‚Äîor at
least it‚Äôs <em>my</em> goal when I perform in this situtation. So I (like any
performer) feed off the good vibes, replenishing (to some extent) my brain
juice.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It‚Äôs a bit clearer to see in a picture:</p>

<picture style="position: relative;">
  <img alt="system diagram for the livecoder-in-a-club system" src="/assets/images/posts/livecoder-in-a-club-system-diagram.png" />

  
</picture>

<p>So, clearly,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a livecoder is a machine for turning <strong>brain juice</strong> into <strong>good vibes</strong> (via
<strong>code</strong> and <strong>music</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which is a nice way to think about it, and actually is a relatively accurate
picture of what I <em>feel</em> is going on when I‚Äôm performing.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-cybernetics-help-us-understand-and-improve-this-system">How does cybernetics help us understand and improve this system?</h2>

<p>In this account of livecoding-in-the-club, there are a few things worth
noticing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>there are different ‚Äústocks‚Äù (reservoirs of brain juice, code, music and good vibes)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there are various flows between those stocks, and in both directions (e.g. I
turn brain juice into code by typing at my keyboard, but I also receive
information about what the code looks like from my laptop screen, via my eyes)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>there‚Äôs a goal: to put on a good show for the audience to enjoy (to increase
the stock of good vibes in the room)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the system includes closed loops, and so is capable of feedback</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A key principle of cybernetics is that the structure of the system‚Äîwhat the
parts are, and how they relate to one another‚Äîdetermines the behaviour of the
system. But anyone can sketch out a (highly contestable) jumble of blobs and
arrows to describe whatever thing they‚Äôre interested in. What do we gain from
seeing things in this way?</p>

<p>This is where another key idea‚Äîand person‚Äîin cybernetics/systems thinking
comes in: Donella Meadows‚Äô<sup id="fnref:is-meadows-cybernetics" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:is-meadows-cybernetics" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> <a href="https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/">Leverage Points: Places to
Intervene in a
System</a>.
The key idea is this: once you‚Äôve mapped out your system, you need to know where
the most effective ‚Äúintervention points‚Äù to try and implement change? If you‚Äôre
going to expend energy to make things better, where should you focus that energy
to get the most <em>leverage</em>?</p>

<p>In the livecoder-in-the-club system, to make changes to the system in service of
the the goal (as stated above) of creating maximum good vibes. One obvious
solution is to start the gig with a bigger reservoir of brain juice (either by
having a good night‚Äôs sleep, popping an adderall, or whatever). Or it could be
to start with a larger code reservoir by starting with a bunch of code
pre-written<sup id="fnref:blank-slate-code" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:blank-slate-code" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>However, Meadows‚Äô rules for leverage also suggest that some interventions
provide more leverage than others<sup id="fnref:different-interventions" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:different-interventions" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. For example,
changing the flow rates (leverage point #10) is likely to have more impact than
just changing the sizes of the stocks/buffers (leverage point #11). This implies
that changing the rate at which I turn brain juice into code (perhaps having a
nicer keyboard, perhaps having better code auto-completion support, or perhaps
just good-ol‚Äô <em>practice</em> to improve my coding skills) is likely to be more
impactful than starting with a bigger store of brain juice (so, thankfully,
there‚Äôs no need to buy shady adderall on the dark web). Will Larson (who has
been a software engineering leader at Calm, Stripe, Uber, and Digg) <a href="https://lethain.com/systems-thinking/">has some
interesting ideas on systems thinking as applied to software
development</a> that I‚Äôm keen to think more
about as well.</p>

<p>For even greater leverage, there are interventions which are related to
restructuring the system itself, for example adding new information flows
(leverage point #6). The dancers can already see the code, but what if I was
hooked up to a live <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography">EEG</a>
so they could see the current state of my brain juice?<sup id="fnref:eeg" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:eeg" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. And even higher up (in
terms of leverage) is changing the goals of the system itself (leverage point
#3). Why <em>do</em> people come to a club to dance and have good vibes? What if their
goal was different?</p>

<p>Now, the thing about leverage is that it doesn‚Äôt guarantee good or bad outcomes,
it just means you for a small amount of input you see a large effect in the
output. Figuring out where to intervene in the livecoder-in-the-club system is
one thing, figuring out how to intervene so that the changes are positive is a
deep challenge. Leverage means that when things go well they go really well, but
the opposite is also true (e.g. with margin calls in a bear market). I feel like
this is an especially apposite point for programmers, because the cheap leverage
afforded by software is catnip for programmers, but presents some real dangers.
(as <a href="https://idlewords.com/talks/sase_panel.htm">as Maciej Ceg≈Çowski puts so
eloquently</a>).</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-the-point">So what‚Äôs the point?</h2>

<p>Obviously the livecoder-in-the-club system described above is an
oversimplification; it makes certain things easy to see but renders other things
invisible, and every aspect of both the components (the things it talks about)
and their relationships (the connections between them) is contestable. But
that‚Äôs one of the benefits by laying things out like this‚Äîwe can at least see
the things that we‚Äôre explicitly considering, and we may well need to add new
things to the model for consideration (and examine all the new connections and
potential feedback loops those new things create).</p>

<p>My main goal here is really just to provide a worked example of how ideas from
cybernetics and systems thinking can help us move beyond just describing things
to figuring out where to place our energies to effect change‚Äîwhere we‚Äôll get
the most leverage. Being the best livecoder I can be is a lifetime goal, just
like any other instrumental or artistic practice. I‚Äôm keen to keep using the
tools of cybernetics to push in that direction, and bring the assemblage of
dancing bodies of the livecoder-in-the-club system with me for the ride :)</p>

tended to prefer terms like ‚Äúsystems thinking‚Äù and ‚Äúsystems change‚Äù rather
than using the term ‚Äúcybernetics‚Äù directly, but she certainly was involved
with some of the key people &amp; events in the cybernetics story, and her work
is highly relevant to cybernetic ideas. Plus, <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Thinking_in_Systems.html?id=leE8R9pehg4C&amp;redir_esc=y">Google Books categorises her

      <p>This is actually a subtle point in livecoding. I (along with some other
livecoders) am committed to starting each gig ‚Äúfrom scratch‚Äù with a blank
code page. However, I‚Äôve written a lot of library code ahead of time to
provide me with nice abstractions for making music with code, and I use that
(hidden‚Äînot on the screen) from the very first line of code that I write.
Thinking about the livecoder-in-the-club system one question that I‚Äôm
pondering is whether that library code constitutes a larger stock of code,
or whether it‚Äôs a restructuring (an increase) of the flow rate from code
into music, or both.</p>

      <p>To make things even more complicated, and there‚Äôs <em>kindof</em> a blurry line
between where the code ends and the music begins in livecoding (i.e. there‚Äôs
the code you see on the screen, which is the code that I‚Äôm writing &amp;
executing ‚Äúlive‚Äù, but there‚Äôs also a bunch of pre-written code in my
operating system‚Äôs audio plumbing just to get the music to come out of the
speakers properly).¬†<a href="#fnref:blank-slate-code" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

<a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> to create open (CC-licenced), hackable, acessible
course websites &amp; teaching content for our classes. We use a self-hosted GitLab
server for all the websites sources, and then build/deploy them with <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/">GitLab
CI</a>. It works well, it means I don‚Äôt have to
fight with our LMS to do interesting things, and it means I can open my learning
materials to everyone (not just those who are privileged enough to be able to
pay the fees to study at the ANU).</p>

<p>The <code>jekyll build</code> step runs in a container, and for a long time we‚Äôve just used
the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby/">official ruby image</a> as a starting point,
then done a <code>bundle install</code> inside the container before running the build step
to get all the deps. However, this means the deps are <em>installed from scratch on
every deploy</em>, which isn‚Äôt the greenest (although ANU is <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/research/research-initiatives/anu-below-zero">heading in a good
direction on net
zero</a>) and
it also means the feedback loop from push-&gt;deployed site is much longer than it
needs to be.</p>

<p>Yesterday (prompted by the understandable frustrations of my colleague
<a href="https://charlesmartin.com.au">Charles</a> about the build times) I spent some time
fixing things. I ended up creating a new docker image with the required gems
pre-installed, and it <strong>cut our CI pipeline times by up to 90%</strong> (i.e. a 10x
speedup).</p>

<p>There were a couple of tricky parts, so I include some commentary here in case
anyone else (including future me when if I forget how this works) wants to do
similar things.</p>

<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile"># Choose and name our temporary image.
FROM ruby:3.0.2 as builder

WORKDIR /app

# Take an SSH key as a build argument.
ARG SSH_PRIVATE_KEY

# required to pull from the (private) theme gem repos
# create the SSH directory.
RUN mkdir -p ~/.ssh/ &amp;&amp; \
  # populate the private key file.
  echo "$SSH_PRIVATE_KEY" &gt; ~/.ssh/id_rsa &amp;&amp; \
  # set the required permissions.
  chmod -R 600 ~/.ssh/ &amp;&amp; \
  # add our GitLab server to our list of known hosts for ssh.
  ssh-keyscan -t rsa gitlab.anu.edu.au &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/known_hosts

# install the deps - this is really just for "caching", the expectation is that
# the CI job will re-run `bundle install` to pick up any differences
COPY Gemfile Gemfile.lock* .
RUN bundle install

# Choose the base image for our final image
FROM ruby:3.0.2
WORKDIR /app

# Copy across the files from our `builder` container
# this really assumes the same base container
COPY --from=builder $BUNDLE_APP_CONFIG $BUNDLE_APP_CONFIG
</code></pre>

<p>The main tricky bit is the ssh setup, because some of the (in-house) gems are
only available in git repos which require authentication. This Dockerfile pulls
in the SSH key from an environment variable, then uses it to <code>bundle install</code>
the required gems. Then, the key part is that there‚Äôs a second <code>FROM</code> command to
create a new image (sans any trace of the SSH key) and only the installed gems
are copied across.</p>

<p>To build the container, you need to do something like</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">MY_KEY=$(cat gitlab-ci-runner-key)
docker build --build-arg SSH_PRIVATE_KEY="$MY_KEY" --tag YOUR_TAG_NAME .
</code></pre>

<p>A couple of caveats with this approach: the container just caches the gems; the
<code>bundle install</code> step will still (probably) need to run in the CI pipeline, but
it‚Äôll be a no-op if <code>Gemfile.lock</code> hasn‚Äôt changed. You‚Äôll never be worse off
(time-wise) than if you‚Äôre installing from scratch, because only the deps which
have changed in the lock file will be downloaded. But over time, the container
may take longer to run as the list of pre-installed vs actually required
packages diverges.</p>

<p class="hl-para">I did try a similar approach that used <code>bundle cache</code> to pull all the deps into
a <code>vendor/cache</code> folder and then copy <em>that</em> across into the new image, but I
had weird permissions errors that I didn‚Äôt have the time to figure out. If
you‚Äôve got tips on whether that‚Äôs a more ‚Äúbundler-y‚Äù way to do things then <a href="mailto:ben@benswift.me">hit
me up</a>.</p>

<p>I want to give a shoutout to Jan Akerman who wrote <a href="https://janakerman.co.uk/docker-git-clone/">a helpful blog
post</a> which got me started‚Äîand
some of the Dockerfile is taken from that post.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ben Swift</name></author><category term="tools" /><category term="web" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I (and, increasingly many of my colleagues) are using Jekyll to create open (CC-licenced), hackable, acessible course websites &amp; teaching content for our classes.

port 22 is now blocked from off-campus. That‚Äôs a real pain if you use ssh to
push/pull from our on-prem GitLab servers (which I need to do <em>all the time</em>).</p>

<p>The recommended solution is to come in via a VPN‚Äîwhich is not a terrible idea
in principle. However, the institution‚Äôs recommended setup requires some janky
GlobalProtect client, which (for me at least) was pretty crashy. As an
alternative, <a href="http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/">openconnect</a> is just a
<code>brew install openconnect</code> away (on macOS, at least), and after a bit of setting
up, it works seamlessly.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre in a similar situation, here‚Äôs a terminal command you can use to
access the campus network via the VPN:</p>

<pre><code>sudo openconnect \
  --user=uXXXXXXX \ ## replace with your uid
  --protocol=gp \   ## because it's a GlobalProtect VPN
  https://staff-access.anu.edu.au
</code></pre>

<p>The above command will prompt for your usual password, which you enter in the
terminal. Since I already have that info in an encrypted file, I have a slightly
modified setup (this is in a script called <code>vpn.sh</code>):</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env zsh

# pull ANU password out of encrypted authinfo file, pipe it to stdin
gpg -q --for-your-eyes-only --no-tty -d ~/.authinfo.gpg | \
    awk '/machine smtp.office365.com login uXXXXXXX@anu.edu.au/ {print $NF}' | \
    # start the VPN
    sudo openconnect --user=uXXXXXXX --protocol=gp --passwd-on-stdin https://staff-access.anu.edu.au
</code></pre>

<p>Happy VPN-ing.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ben Swift</name></author><category term="tools" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My institution‚Äôs IT policies have recently changed and port 22 is now blocked from off-campus.

will hopefully be fun. Before my guest lecture, I‚Äôd like to introduce you (if
you haven‚Äôt seen it before) to <a href="https://toplap.org/about/">livecoding</a>. Imagine

<h2 id="what-can-cybernetics-teach-us-about-this">What can cybernetics teach us about this?</h2>

<p>Obviously there are lots of feedback loops in this CPS; involving
audience/room/livecoder/screens/lights/loudspeakers etc. But one of the things
that interests me most about livecoding is that it gives the club-goers a chance
to see (and hopefully to <em>care</em>) about the source code of a computer program.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs lots we could say about this from a cybernetics perspective, but the
things I want to focus on in this class is <em>feedback</em>.</p>

<p>Here are a few questions for you to think about ahead of class. In each
livecoding video:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what has the performer chosen to <em>show</em>?</li>
  <li>what has the performer chosen to <em>hide</em>?</li>
  <li>who is the feedback <em>for</em><sup id="fnref:cui" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cui" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>?</li>
  <li>in each case, why do you think those decisions were made?</li>
  <li>when watching, what did <em>you</em> want more/less/different feedback about?</li>
  <li>if you were the AV designer for Ushini &amp; my next livecoding set, what changes
would you make?</li>
  <li>how does a taking a cybernetic approach to this question change answer to
these questions? (because feedback is something that cybernetics has a fair
bit to say about)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to go a bit deeper on the semiotics of all this livecoding stuff, my
collaborators and I have written a couple of papers<sup id="fnref:gauche" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:gauche" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> on the

Cybernetics</a> in the ANU College of Engineering
and Computer Science (CECS). I‚Äôll finish out my teaching this semester in the
<a href="https://cs.anu.edu.au">School of Computing</a> then I‚Äôll make the move in July.
For those not familiar with the ANU org-chart or acronymicon, there are multiple
<em>Schools</em> in each <em>College</em> (so I‚Äôm moving Schools but staying within the same
College).</p>

<p>I‚Äôm really excited by the prospect of designing educational experiences
in/around/through the <a href="https://www.griffithreview.com/articles/touching-the-future/">new
Cybernetics</a>, and
that‚Äôs what my<sup id="fnref:my" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:my" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> team in the School of Cybernetics will be doing (under our
Director <a href="https://twitter.com/feraldata">Genevieve Bell</a>). My work as an
interdisciplinary computer scientist/computer musician has always been
cybernetics-adjacent, and I‚Äôm stoked to get a chance to lean in to this
interdisciplinarity as we reimagine what a School (within a College, within a
university) might look like.</p>

<p>However, this decision is bittersweet; I love my current job, my colleagues and
(especially) my students, and I‚Äôll be sad to see them less as I move to the
School of Cybernetics. In fact, there are a few things I want to say about this
move, and this blog is as good a place to say them as any.</p>

<p>To <strong>outside observers</strong>, I want to be <em>super clear</em> that I‚Äôm not leaving the
School of Computing because it sucks, or because there‚Äôs no opportunity to do
cool stuff there‚Äîquite the opposite. I think the future of computing is bright
at the ANU and I know there are multiple folks all across the campus working
hard to create that future in the present. To that end, if you‚Äôre an
up-and-coming creative code researcher/practitioner/educator, then you should
apply for a <a href="https://jobs.acm.org/jobs/computing-tenure-track-faculty-positions-canberra-australian-capital-territory-2601-122695751-d">tenure-track position in the School of
Computing</a>‚Äîit‚Äôd
be great to have you join the team, and we‚Äôd have chances to work together I‚Äôm
sure.</p>

<p>To my <strong>School of Computing colleagues</strong>, I really appreciate your collegiality,
support and friendship over these past nine years (I started as a post-doc on 1
Jan ‚Äò13). I‚Äôll still be around (the School of Cybernetics will sit in the Birch
building), and I‚Äôm keen to be a sounding board or collaborator. There are a few
people in particular who have trained and supported me to be the educator that I
am today, and while I won‚Äôt do the full ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to thank‚Ä¶‚Äù Oscars acceptance
speech thing, I hope you know who you are, and how much I appreciate it.</p>

<p>To the <strong>School of Computing admin team</strong>, you‚Äôre awesome. I‚Äôll miss hassling
you on Teams to buy weird gear for the Laptop Ensemble.</p>

<p>To my <strong>current students</strong>, I (and my new colleagues in the School of
Cybernetics) will make sure you don‚Äôt get stuffed around. I‚Äôll keep supervising
all my current students till your projects are complete, and you won‚Äôt notice
much difference‚Äîjust that from July onwards we might have our meetings in a
different building. If you‚Äôre in my new <a href="https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/extn1019/">ANU Extension Creative
Computing</a> course, then there‚Äôs good
news as well‚Äîthat course will keep going as planned. In fact, it‚Äôs a high
priority activity for the whole College, and there will be amazing doors that
open up for you through participation in that course. If you‚Äôre a year 11
student in 2022, you can start thinking about applying to be part of next year‚Äôs
cohort‚Äî<a href="mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au">drop me a line</a> if you‚Äôd like some tips
on how to prepare for that process.</p>

<p>To any <strong>prospective/future students</strong> (i.e. those who were hoping to take <a href="/teaching/">one
of my classes</a> in the future) the news is a bit more
mixed. I‚Äôll still be involved with the <a href="https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2710-lens/">Laptop
Ensemble</a>, and the current plan is
that other courses I‚Äôve designed &amp; taught (e.g.
<a href="https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/">COMP2300</a>,
<a href="https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/">COMP1720</a>) will still continue as
normal with <a href="https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/people/charles-martin/">other (excellent!)
lecturers</a>.
Finally, while I was previously scheduled to take over <strong>COMP4610 Computer
Graphics</strong> in S2 2021, this now won‚Äôt happen. If that stuffs up your study
plans, I‚Äôm really sorry.</p>

<p>Finally, while I‚Äôm taking on new and exciting responsibilities in the School of
Cybernetics, I‚Äôll still be the same person with the same interests, strengths
and weaknesses. So if we‚Äôre excited about the same things now, chances are we‚Äôll
still be excited about the same things into the future‚Äîand I hope we have the
opportunity to support one another to pursue those goals.</p>
