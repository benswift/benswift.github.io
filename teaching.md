Computers are just so _useful_ in all domains of human endeavour, and giving
people the skills to do interesting things with them is really important work. I
really enjoy it, too :)

I'm currently teaching two courses in the [ANU Research School of Computer
Science](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/)

- [COMP2710/6470: Laptop Ensemble](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2710-lens/)
  in **Semester 1 (Feb--Jun)** is a course open to students in computer science,
  music, art, and elsewhere at ANU (the course is co-taught with MUSI2205 in the
  _ANU School of Music_). In this course students learn fundamental skills of
  music computing, including digital synthesis, algorithmic composition, and
  musical interface design, putting these skills to use creating a computer
  musical instrument, composition, or interactive media work to present in
  concert at the end of the course.

- [EXTN1019: ANU Extension Creative
  Computing](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/creative-computing/)
  in **Semester 1 (Feb--Jun)** is a course where ACT Year 11 & 12 students learn
  the fundamentals of computer programming through the creative process of
  making music and visual art. As well as creating and performing their own new
  works of code-based art & music, this course contributes towards the students'
  ATAR _and_ they receive credit towards an undergraduate computing degree if
  they choose to study at ANU. As the School of Computing's first ever [ANU
  Extension](https://extension.anu.edu.au) course, this program attracts
  fantastic students who might otherwise not study engineering or computer
  science (either at ANU or elsewhere) and helps them _reimagine_ what it is to
  be a computer scientist or engineer in the 21st century.

In the past couple of years, I've also taught

- [COMP2300/6300: Computer Organisation and Program
  Execution](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/) is ANU's introductory
  computer architecture course, which I wrote and delivered from 2017--2018, and
  is now being delivered by [Uwe
  Zimmer](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/zimmer-ur) (don't worry,
  it's still the same discoboard-powered synthmaking extravaganza ðŸ˜œ). In this
  course students take a complex computer system ([the STM32L476G discovery
  "disco" board](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32l476gdiscovery.html))
  home from week 1. That might seem daunting---and it's true that there's more
  stuff on such a board than one can master in one semester---but students can
  still learn a lot about CPUs (and how programs are organised and executed) by
  the end of the course.

- [COMP1720/6720: Art & Interaction in New Media](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/)
  is a course about learning to tell stories through interactive code art. It's
  not _just_ an art course, and it's not _just_ a "coding" course: students
  engage with both of those domains at the same time, and (I hope) have a lot of
  fun in the process. No previous coding or artistic experience is required:
  COMP1720 teaches everything from the ground up.

- The [COMP2710 _Internet of Things_ China Study
  Tour](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/china-study-tour/) is an in-country
  intensive study course conducted in partnership with the [Beijing Institute of
  Technology](http://english.bit.edu.cn/). In this course students learn about
  low-cost, network-connected embedded computing devices & their relationship to
  the broader computing landscape through building a prototype IoT artefact (and
  releasing the source code, parts list and build instructions on GitHub), while
  reflecting on the design, security, social and ethical challenges associated
  with the Internet of Things. The photo at the top of this page was taken with
  the students from the 2018 cohort of this course.

If you're a student at the ANU, then I encourage you to take one (or more!) of
these courses---I think they're pretty great :)

I also give regular [guest lectures]({% link talks.md %}) &
run workshops on various topics in my areas of expertise. If you're interested
in hiring me as a speaker, [get in touch](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au).
