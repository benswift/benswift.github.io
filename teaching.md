Computers are just so *useful* in all domains of human endeavour, and giving
people the skills to do interesting things with them is really important work. I
really enjoy it, too :)

I'm currently teaching three courses in the [ANU Research School of Computer
Science](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/)

- in **Semester 1 (Feb-Jun)** I teach [COMP2300: Computer Organisation and
  Program Execution](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/) (*note*: I'm on
  parental leave for S1 2019, so I won't be teaching the course this time
  around---but the course will still be the same)

- in **Semester 2 (Jul-Nov)** I teach [COMP1720: Art & Interaction in New
  Media](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/)

- in **Summer (Dec-Feb)** I teach [COMPCHST: Internet of Things China Study
  Tour](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/china-study-tour/) at the Beijing
  Institute of Technology

If you're a student at the ANU, then I encourage you to take one (or more!) of
these courses---I think they're pretty great :)

I also give regular guest lectures & run workshops on various topics in my areas
of expertise. If you're interested in hiring me as a speaker, [get in
touch](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au).
