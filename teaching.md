# Teaching

Computers are just so _useful_ in all domains of human endeavour, and giving
people the skills to do interesting things with them is really important work. I
really enjoy it, too :)

I'm currently on a teaching break, but I'll be back in S2 2026 with a new
course:
[COMP4020/8020: Rapid Prototyping for the Web](https://comp.anu.edu.au/study/special-topics/).

## Upcoming courses

- [COMP4020/8020: Rapid Prototyping for the Web](https://comp.anu.edu.au/study/special-topics/)
  is a _brand new course in S2 2026_. I'm currently finalising the content, but
  here's the blurb:

  > LLM agents, which run tools (e.g. search the web, edit files, run code) in a
  > loop to achieve a goal, offer a new workflow for developing software. This
  > is especially true for application domains which are well-represented in LLM
  > training sets---like the web.
  >
  > Moving beyond naive "vibecoding", this course provides a studio-based
  > "iterate and test with working prototypes" approach to rapidly prototyping
  > web apps. In the weekly lectures students will learn fundamental concepts
  > and practical skills for harnessing an agentic AI/LLM development workflow.
  > In the weekly "studio session" tutorials, students will demo their
  > work-in-progress prototypes and receive feedback from peers and instructors.
  > By the end of the course each student will have designed, developed and
  > deployed _multiple_ web apps prototypes using a rapid, feedback-driven
  > process.

## Past courses

- [COMP2710/6470: Laptop Ensemble](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/laptop-ensemble/)
  in **Semester 1 (Feb--Jun)** is a course open to students in computer science,
  music, art, and elsewhere at ANU (the course is co-taught with MUSI2205 in the
  _ANU School of Music_). In this course students learn fundamental skills of
  music computing, including digital synthesis, algorithmic composition, and
  musical interface design, putting these skills to use creating a computer
  musical instrument, composition, or interactive media work to present in
  concert at the end of the course.

- [EXTN1019: ANU Extension Creative Computing](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/extn1019/)
  in **Semester 1 (Feb--Jun)** is a course where ACT Year 11 & 12 students learn
  the fundamentals of computer programming through the creative process of
  making music and visual art. As well as creating and performing their own new
  works of code-based art & music, this course contributes towards the students'
  ATAR _and_ they receive credit towards an undergraduate computing degree if
  they choose to study at ANU.

- [COMP2300/6300: Computer Organisation and Program Execution](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/)
  is ANU's introductory computer architecture course, which I wrote and
  delivered from 2017--2018. In this course students take a complex computer
  system (the STM32L476G discovery "disco" board) home from week 1 and learn
  about CPUs and how programs are organised and executed.

- [COMP1720/6720: Art & Interaction in New Media](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/)
  is a course about learning to tell stories through interactive code art. No
  previous coding or artistic experience is required: COMP1720 teaches
  everything from the ground up.

- The
  [COMP2710 _Internet of Things_ China Study Tour](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/china-study-tour/)
  is an in-country intensive study course conducted in partnership with the
  Beijing Institute of Technology.

If you're a student at the ANU, then I encourage you to take one (or more!) of
these courses---I think they're pretty great :)

I also give regular [guest lectures](/talks/) & run workshops on various topics
in my areas of expertise. If you're interested in hiring me as a speaker,
[get in touch](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au).
