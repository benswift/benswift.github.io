Note: this is a personal bio page. If you're after a more "researcher-y" bio,
then have a look at my [research page]({% link research.md %}), or check out my
[CV]({% link cv.md %}) (which contains a lot of the same stuff).

I'm a [Canberra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra) lad, born and bred. One
day I may move away from this place, but for now I'm here and quite happy about
it.

I have one wife, two kids, zero pets, two bikes and four guitars. They all make
me happy (in monotonically weakly decreasing order).

On the weekends I ride my mountain bike, play football (soccer), watch the footy
(AFL) and cricket and go to church. I'm also trying to learn Mandarin so that I
can better communicate with my in-laws.
