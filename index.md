Hi, I'm Ben Swift---I'm a [researcher](/research), [artist](/livecoding/) and
[creative technologist/software engineer](https://github.com/benswift), and
(among other things) I lead the Cybernetic Studio at the
[ANU School of Cybernetics](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/). Sometimes I write
about that stuff on my [blog](/blog/).

I care a lot about making computing a welcoming, interesting and creatively
satisfying place, especially for people who don't fit the traditional picture of
a "computer scientist".

If you'd like to get in touch---and please do!---you can email me at
[ben.swift@anu.edu.au](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au).
