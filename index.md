# Ben Swift's homepage

Hi, I'm Ben Swift---I'm a
[scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OQdYgLEAAAAJ), [artist]({%
link livecoding.md %}) and [maker](https://github.com/benswift), and one half of
the core development team for the
[Extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore) livecoding environment.

I'm an [Educational Experiences Developer (Senior
Lecturer)](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/ben-swift) in the [School of
Cybernetics](https://3ainstitute.org) at the [Australian National
University](https://anu.edu.au/) in Canberra, Australia, where I lead the [c/c/c
(code/creativity/culture)
studio](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/). The **c/c/c studio** is
a teaching & research group which exists to open up spaces for discussion about
the way that `code` is shaping flows of information/culture/humanity in today's
(and tomorrow's) world.

I care a lot about making computing a welcoming, interesting and creatively
satisfying place, especially for people who don't fit the traditional picture of
a "computer scientist".

If you'd like to get in touch---and please do!---the best options are
