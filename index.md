Hi, I'm Ben Swift---I'm a
[scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OQdYgLEAAAAJ), [artist]({%
link livecoding.md %}) and [creative technologist](https://github.com/benswift),
and one half of the core development team for the
[Extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore) livecoding environment.

I'm the [Educational Experiences team
lead](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/people/ben-swift/) (Senior Lecturer) in the
[School of Cybernetics](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au) at the [Australian
National University](https://anu.edu.au/) in Canberra, Australia. I'm also the
director of the the [c/c/c (code/creativity/culture)
studio](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/) (home of the [ANU Laptop
Ensemble](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/laptop-ensemble/)). The **c/c/c
studio** is a teaching & research group which exists to open up spaces for
discussion about the way that `code` is shaping flows of
information/culture/humanity in today's (and tomorrow's) world.

I care a lot about making computing a welcoming, interesting and creatively
satisfying place, especially for people who don't fit the traditional picture of
a "computer scientist".
