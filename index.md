Hi, I'm Ben Swift---I'm a [researcher]({% link research.md %}), [artist]({% link
livecoding.md %}) and
[creative technologist/software engineer](https://github.com/benswift), and
(among other things) I lead the Cybernetic Studio at the
[ANU School of Cybernetics](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/). Sometimes I write
about that stuff on my [blog]({% link blog.md %}).

I care a lot about making computing a welcoming, interesting and creatively
satisfying place, especially for people who don't fit the traditional picture of
a "computer scientist".

If you'd like to get in touch---and please do!---you can email me at
<mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au>.
