My presentation to the
[1st International Workshop on Live Programming (LIVE)](https://liveprogramming.github.io/2013/),
part of ICSE '13. This [short paper](/research#swiftVisualCodeAnnotations2013)
spells out a lot of the ideas that Andrew Sorensen and I were thinking about at
the time (and since). It's only a short paper, so it doesn't cover the topic in
detail, but I think it's still a pretty neat articulation of some of the
thinking behind the Extempore design decisions.
