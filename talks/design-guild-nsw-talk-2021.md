> My topic is the shift from 'architect' to 'gardener', where 'architect' stands

> 'gardener' standing for 'someone who plants seeds and waits to see exactly

> Second, treating the world as a software project gives us a rationale for
> being selfish... We are used to the idea of bootstrapping ourselves into a
> position of maximum leverage before tackling a problem.
