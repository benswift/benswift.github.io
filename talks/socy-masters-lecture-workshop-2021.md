(I assume you've done the
[pre-reading/watching](/blog/2021/09/13/feedback-in-livecoding-cui-bono))

the **central problem** of laptop performance

what do you think oldmate is doing?

## what does cybernetics say?

> control & communication in the (livecoding) animal and the machine

what are the flows of information (control & communication)?

and for whose benefit (cui bono)?

<SlideBackgroundImage image="images/talks/socy-masters-lecture-workshop-2021/ben-ushini-acmc21-frame.webp" />

in watching the video, what did you **pay attention** to, and why?

what information was missing; what _else_ did you want to know
before/during/after?

_(5min breakout rooms)_

_hint_: later, you'll get to have your say about how these flows could be
improved

set design, which is sometimes referred to as scenic design, refers to the
design and creation of the sets used in works of performance art

pitch time---what's your vision for my (and [Ushini's](https://ushini.com))
livecoding performance setup?

_(10min breakout rooms, then 10min shareback)_

## some questions to ponder?

- what sensory modalities (sound/visuals/etc) can you use?
- what do K-pop stars/comedians/twitch streamers/DJs/etc. do well?
- what feedback should the _performer_ get?
- what information should be _hidden_?
- what's the goal? what state should the system steer towards, and how?
- where are the feedback **loops**?

remember: it's a pitch... you've gotta sell it (with theory!)

1--2 min per group

## what's next?

it's a genuine open question for me (and other livecoders) in their creative
practice

if you'd like to help/collaborate/jam, let me know 😊
