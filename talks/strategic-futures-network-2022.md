## outline

- cybernetics and the history of futures
- futures @ the ANU School of Cybernetics
- _cybernetic futures_: a WIP

the study of purposeful, self-regulating systems

## a short, mostly wrong story of futures in the 20th Century

## cybernetic futures takeaways

1. the **stories** we tell about the future influence the systems we build in
   the present (and vice versa)

2. the **relationships** determine the long-term behaviour of the system (e.g.
   exponential growth vs balance)

(semi)autonomous AI components within systems _feels like_ it's gonna be transformative

<!-- class: fragment -->

SOCY exists to provide tools to manage that transformation... including
cybernetic futures

<SlideBackgroundImage image="images/talks/strategic-futures-network-2022/wesley-tingey--Irs24DzLxM-unsplash.jpg" heading="what tools do we use?" />

we primarily run short (2h or less) workshops, sometimes as a one-off, sometimes
with some followup

heavy use of scenarios

two example activities which link back to the two key takeaways: **stories**, and **relationships**

<SlideBackgroundImage image="images/talks/whls-2022/ttftf-playing-cards.jpg" heading="stories: the thing from the future" />

in pairs, come up with a (post-it note sized) description of a **thing from the
future** according to a prompt:

in a \_\_\_\_ future, there is a \_\_\_\_ related to \_\_\_\_... what is it?

## relationships: influence diagrams for futures

- participants have some shared system they care about
- collaboratively identify components & pairwise relationships between them
- (in software) look for the loops, and use these as the "drivers" for creating
  future scenarios, which are then analysed for plausibility/preferability
- some AI stuff involved in the scenario creation (WIP!)

just trying to add tools to the futures toolbelt, especially in the "systems of
autonomous systems" age

because unless you've invented your own framework, are you really even futuring?
