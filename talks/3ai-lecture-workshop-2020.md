The code/creativity/culture (c/c/c) studio is a research & creative practice
collective within the Research School of Computer Science. We exist to open up
spaces for discussion about the way that `code` is shaping flows of
information/culture/humanity in today's (and tomorrow's) world.

## collaborative task 1 (5mins)

- nominate a storyteller
- at this point, we're thinking in _generalities_

it's complicated

## indicators

> How do we measure performance and success?
>
> Technical systems have typically been measured on their efficiency. However,
> when systems start to learn and change their behaviour over time, the
> objective of efficiency may begin to clash with ideals that have previously
> been implicitly or tacitly inserted into the process by the humans in the
> loop. How do we start to conceptualise building for sustainability, for
> beauty, for values?

## interfaces

> How will technologies, systems and humans work together?
>
> In previous decades, we interfaced with computational systems through a screen
> and a keyboard. This paradigm is already being disrupted as ‘smart’ objects
> enter our lives. What will it mean when AI-enabled systems are all around us,
> sensing and responding to us? How to do protect our privacy? What happens to
> all that data?

## intent

> Why has the system been constructed? by whom? and for what purposes?
>
> It is sometimes tempting to think of a single, monolithic AI. However, AIs
> will be built for different purposes and with very different intentionality,
> and inside different larger systems. Making sense of, and mapping, that
> broader intentionality is central to the emergent new applied science.

## collaborative task 2 (10mins)

design intervention: what scaffolding could you provide to move the needle on
u&e in a livecoding gig?

- context/staging
- preamble/postamble
- auxilliary sound/visuals
- examples/guidelines
- ...

## what's next?

these questions keep me up at night

if you'd like to help (or just to hang out with the c/c/c group more generally)
then let me know 😊
