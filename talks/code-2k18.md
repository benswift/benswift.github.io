the next generation of new media creators are spread across the **whole campus**

innovation/entrepreneurship programs are all the rage

Our provocation:

<!-- class: fragment -->

the modern university has a huge untapped potential for new media content
creation, but departmental silos stifle its flourishing; and current
'de-silofication' initiatives (e.g. innovation/entrepreneurship) are too
crassly-commercial to support many forms of collaborative content creation

<!-- class: fragment -->

**what pragmatic, short-lead-time activities can we support to release this
untapped potential?**

the ANU **L**aptop **Ens**emble

run by Alec and I through our
[TechLauncher](https://cs.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/) innovation/entrepreneurship
program

currently ~10 students from computer science, art and music

<!-- class: fragment -->

it's gone pretty well (several student-driven gigs around campus)

<SlideBackgroundImage image="images/talks/code-2k18/lens-open-day-brent-ushini.webp" heading="pedagogically" />

<!-- class: fragment -->

students bring their existing skills (great!) but **lots** of missing knowledge
between domains

creation without _critique_

what can we do to release this **huge untapped potential**?
