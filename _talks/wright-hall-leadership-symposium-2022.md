event: Wright Hall Leadership Symposium '22
title: Futures of Individuals and Institutions
subtitle: a <em>participatory</em> keynote
date: "2022-07-22"
permalink: /talks/wright-hall-leadership-symposium-2022/
summary: >-
  For some, the events of the last couple of years have reminded us of the
  fragility of the stories we tell about the future, both as individuals and as
  part of broader institutions. While some of these lessons have been hard, in
  some cases seeing the "default" pictures of what's going to happen evaporate
  before our eyes has opened us up to new possibilities and empowered us to act
  with more purpose in the present. Telling different and better stories about the
  future---and the individuals and institutions within them---allows us to make
  clearer decisions about where to conform, and where we might be empowered to
  make change.

  Dr Ben Swift (Cybernetic Experiences lead at the 
  [ANU School of Cybernetics](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au)) will
  share his story as an individual within institutions, some thoughts about the
  power of the stories we tell about the future, and lead some participatory
  activities to imagine new, different and (hopefully) better futures for our
  individuals and institutions.
