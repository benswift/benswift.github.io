> My topic is the shift from 'architect' to 'gardener', where 'architect' stands
> for 'someone who carries a full picture of the work before it is made', to
> 'gardener' standing for 'someone who plants seeds and waits to see exactly
> what will come up'. I will argue that today's composer are more frequently
> 'gardeners' than 'architects' and, further, that the 'composer as architect'
> metaphor was a transitory historical blip.

> First, programmers are trained to seek maximal and global solutions. Why solve
> a specific problem in one place when you can fix the general problem for
> everybody, and for all time?
>
> Second, treating the world as a software project gives us a rationale for
> being selfish... We are used to the idea of bootstrapping ourselves into a
> position of maximum leverage before tackling a problem.
