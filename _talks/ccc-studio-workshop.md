The code/creativity/culture group (c/c/c) is a research group within the
Research School of Computer Science. Our goal is to create spaces for _talking_,
_thinking_ and _making_ about the way that **code** (software), **creativity**
(especially the arts) and **culture** (life) intersect in the modern world.

(from the [c/c/c website](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/))

{% include slides/background-image.html image="images/posts/comp1720-mp-exhibition-2018-2.jpg" heading="the c/c/c studio" %}

an [ANU Extension](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/) program to
teach computer science to year 11 & 12 students through making art, music and
other cool things with computers

curriculum being developed right now (using
[COMP1720](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/) & [COMP2710 Laptop
Ensemble](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/lens/) as a starting
point, but everything's up for grabs!)

first student intake (year 11 only) in 2021, first graduates in 2022

_your design brief for today_: in your group, create an assessment task which
teaches a particular **code** concept/tool by exploring a problem/challenge
facing our **culture** through a particular **creative** process/medium

it might be used in the c/c/c studio ðŸ˜Š

look for the stickers on your table

**red**&nbsp;<span style="color:#eb4d4b;">â¬¤</span> = _code_

**blue**&nbsp;<span style="color:#3498db;">â¬¤</span> = _creativity_

**yellow**&nbsp;<span style="color:#f1c40f;">â¬¤</span> = _culture_

**purple**&nbsp;<span style="color:#8e44ad;">â¬¤</span> = ðŸ’©

each group must have _all_ of the stickers between them

## your task today

your group needs to produce a document describing your assessment item,
including:

- description
- background/motivation
- learning outcomes
- spec
- resources
- faq

there are lots of details on the workshop content page

**think**: how do we inspire & motivate _everyone_ to make, and in doing so, to learn?

**talk**: what are the opportunities of the c/c/c framing? what are the problems?

**make**: produce an _actual thing_
