what's the _biggest_ number which divides both evenly?

{% include slides/background-image.html image="images/talks/classics-to-colonialism/the-school-of-athens.jpg" heading="the Euclidean algorithm" id="part-1" %}

the Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two
integers is one of the oldest known algorithms (circa 300 B.C.)

first described by Euclid's _Elements, Proposition 2, Book VII_

independently discovered in several other places, (China, India)

## in plain English

To find the **g**reatest **c**ommon **d**ivisor of two numbers (_a_ and _b_),
repeatedly replace the larger of the two numbers by their difference until both
are equal. This final number is then the greatest common divisor.

## why?

early on: astronomy, calendars

these days: _so many thing_ (e.g. number theory, cryptography)

## in code

```extempore
(define (gcd a b)
  (if (= a b)
      a
      (gcd (min a b) (abs (- a b)))))
```

## in code (a bit more efficient)

```extempore
(define (gcd a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (gcd (modulo b a) a)))
```

## implications? {#part-3}

not all widely-used rhythms in the world are Euclidean

low-dimensional interface (2 params, 3 at a stretch) for generating lots of
interesting and culturally-significant rhythms

well... sometimes, but that's not the main point here

look, you learned one earlier---I saw you---so you're guilty as well

we can't hide behind algorithmic disintermediation
