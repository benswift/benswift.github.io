title: Designing the c/c/c studio
subtitle: 10 years of teaching artists to code and coders to art
date: "2020-01-17"
permalink: /talks/designing-the-ccc-studio/
summary: >-
  The arts (music and visual) have always provided a less-travelled but
  fascinating alternate route into computing. As CS Schools around the world
  grapple with how best to teach computing to the next generation(s), is computer
  music/visual art part of the solution? If so, how can we do it without
  introducing _more_ baggage to a curriculum which already throws plenty of other
  "hidden prerequisite" hurdles in front of newcomers? In posing (and probably not
  answering!) these questions I reflect on 10 years of art+code as both an
  educator and creative practitioner, and describe the c/c/c studio: my current
  "Reimagine Fellowship" project to bring creative coding into Australian schools.

## outline

10 years of art & code at ANU

the c/c/c studio and the Reimagine project

discussion questions

{% include slides/impact.html %}

but first, some **music**

## so many qualifications!

10¬π years of teaching artists¬≤ to code¬≥ and coders‚Å¥ to art‚Åµ

1. _10 years_: well, 9 actually (since 2011)
2. _artists_: mix of CS majors, art majors, and others
3. _code_: yeah, I know, CSEd is more than just coding
4. _coders_: see "artists"
5. _art_: to create something of aesthetic/poetic/ethical value

{% include slides/background-image.html image="images/talks/designing-the-ccc-studio/jake-weirick-o9h6KJG52eU-unsplash.jpg" heading="CS @ ANU" %}

loads of students, large classes

some resources are plentiful, others scarce

huge opportunities, but how to make the most of them?

{% include slides/background-image.html image="images/talks/designing-the-ccc-studio/2016-gallery-fun-times.jpg" heading="COMP1720: Art & Interaction in New Media" %}

first-year elective available to both CS & art students

started in 2011 (~50 students)

2019 enrolment: ~250 students (80% CS, 20% art)

major project (40% of total grade) is an interactive browser-based artwork in
p5.js

{% include slides/background-image.html image="images/talks/designing-the-ccc-studio/zach-farmer-TkunxoS98q0-unsplash.jpg" heading="reflections: what's good, what's hard" %}

### good

lots of students new to programming (and some stick around)

forces students to figure out what excellent work even looks like

### hard

even wider range of "starting places" than usual

(some) CS students struggle with the subjectivity

later-year elective available to both CS & music students

started in 2018

"boutique" class: less than 20 students total

flipped mode

whole-class crits & jams

{% include slides/background-image.html image="images/talks/designing-the-ccc-studio/zach-farmer-TkunxoS98q0-unsplash.jpg" heading="reflections: what's good, what's hard" %}

### good

similar to COMP1720

get to assess my students in a nightclub

### hard

getting students to truly work as an _ensemble_

getting students to grow during the course

{% include slides/background-image.html image="images/talks/designing-the-ccc-studio/actoncampus_cropped.jpg" heading="Reimagine" %}

a **$350m+ investment** in CS & Eng @ ANU

new departments, 2x faculty

finding new ways of being a computer scientist

a series of Reimagine Fellowships to support this...

## The c/c/c studio

I've been awarded a fellowship to build the **c/c/c studio**

an A-levels extension course in creative computing (selective entry, 2 year program)

small cohorts (<20/year), first intake in 2021, first graduates in 2022

a joint venture between CS & the art/music schools

## c/c/c studio curriculum

2h on-campus ~4h self-study per week

1st year: interactive visual & generative art ([p5.js](https://p5js.org))

2nd year: computer music & livecoding
([Extempore](https://extemporelang.github.io) & [Pd](https://puredata.info))

studio-based learning: students conceive, plan & build something each year, with
an exhibition at the end

needs to be approved by the board of education

but **why**?

<!-- to attract & welcome new folks to computing -->

<!-- it's a great leveller -->

{:style="font-size:2em;"}

making music & art isn't a side track on the road to computing

## discussion questions

can we go all in on creative coding? i.e. could this be CS101?

how do we make the cultural artefact part of the incentive scheme?

what's the appropriate entrance exam/portfolio/other?

how do we make sure we don't just stretch the privileged kids?

how do we study it?

how do we scale it?

what do we call it?

## what's next?

if you'd like to chat, let me know üòä---I'm here till Thursday

## Bio

Ben is a multidisciplinary researcher and Senior Lecturer in the Research School
of Computer Science at the [Australian National
University](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/ben-swift). He's interested in
computational art & music, human-computer interaction, AI/machine learning
(particularly in pursuit of creative ends) and the intersection of code,
creativity and culture as those boundaries dissolve in the modern world. He's
the director of the [code/creativity/culture
group](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/) within the ANU Research
School of Computer Science.

## Bio

He is a [livecoder]({% link livecoding.md %}), and is the vice
president of the [Australasian Computer Music
Association](https://computermusic.org.au) (ACMA). Ben is one of the inaugural
[ANU Reimagine Fellows]({% link
_posts/2019-08-30-Im-a-reimagine-fellow.md %}), part of a [$300m+ investment
from the ANU](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/reimagine) charged with re-thinking (and
re-doing) what it is to be a computer scientist in the 21st century.
