summary: >-
  The arts (music and visual) have always provided a less-travelled but
  fascinating alternate route into computing. As CS Schools around the world
  grapple with how best to teach computing to the next generation(s), is computer
  music/visual art part of the solution? If so, how can we do it without
  introducing _more_ baggage to a curriculum which already throws plenty of other
  "hidden prerequisite" hurdles in front of newcomers? In posing (and probably not
  answering!) these questions I reflect on 10 years of art+code as both an
  educator and creative practitioner, and describe the c/c/c studio: my current
  "Reimagine Fellowship" project to bring creative coding into Australian schools.

## outline

10 years of art & code at ANU

the c/c/c studio and the Reimagine project

discussion questions

{% include slides/impact.html %}

but first, some **music**

## so many qualifications!

10¹ years of teaching artists² to code³ and coders⁴ to art⁵

1. _10 years_: well, 9 actually (since 2011)
2. _artists_: mix of CS majors, art majors, and others
3. _code_: yeah, I know, CSEd is more than just coding
4. _coders_: see "artists"
5. _art_: to create something of aesthetic/poetic/ethical value

## my story

💻 + 🎵 = 🤯

## COMP1720: Art & Interaction in New Media

first-year elective course for CS & art students

2019 enrolment: ~250 students (80% CS, 20% art)

major project (40% of total grade) is an interactive browser-based artwork in
p5.js

## COMP2710: Laptop Ensemble

TODO

## Reimagine

$350m+ investment in CS & Eng @ ANU

finding new ways of being a computer scientist

## The c/c/c studio

I've been awarded a fellowship to build the **c/c/c studio**

an A-levels extension course in creative computing (selective entry, 2 year program)

timeline: first intake in 2021, first graduations in 2022

## c/c/c studio curriculum

1st year: interactive visual & generative art (p5.js)

2nd year: computer music & livecoding (Extempore & Pd)

but **why**?

<!-- to attract & welcome new folks to computing -->

<!-- it's a great leveller -->

making music & art isn't a side track on the road to computing

## discussion questions

what's the appropriate entrance exam/portfolio/other for this program?

how do we make the cultural artefact part of the incentive scheme?

how do we _scale_ it?

how do we _study_ it?

## what's next?

if you'd like to chat, let me know 😊---I'm here till Thursday

## Bio

Ben is a multidisciplinary researcher and Senior Lecturer in the Research School
of Computer Science at the [Australian National
University](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/ben-swift). He's interested in
computational art & music, human-computer interaction, AI/machine learning
(particularly in pursuit of creative ends) and the intersection of code,
creativity and culture as those boundaries dissolve in the modern world. He's
the director of the [code/creativity/culture
group](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/) within the ANU Research
School of Computer Science.

## Bio

He is a [livecoder]({% link livecoding.md %}), and is the vice
president of the [Australasian Computer Music
Association](https://computermusic.org.au) (ACMA). Ben is one of the inaugural
[ANU Reimagine Fellows]({% link
_posts/2019-08-30-Im-a-reimagine-fellow.md %}), part of a [$300m+ investment
from the ANU](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/reimagine) charged with re-thinking (and
re-doing) what it is to be a computer scientist in the 21st century.
