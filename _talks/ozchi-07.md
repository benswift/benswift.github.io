I gave my first ever conference presentation at [OzCHI
2007](http://www.ozchi.org/ozchi2007/) on the work I did during my honours year.
No funky HTML slides for this (I was way less web-savvy back then) but here are
some pdf slides. There's a [paper in the references section]({%
link research.md %}#swiftMindmodulatedMusicMind2007) as well.

Sometimes it's fun to look back and see how far one has come in their research
skills. Sometimes it's depressing to see how one has stagnated. I'll leave it up
to you to decide which category I'm in ðŸ˜œ
