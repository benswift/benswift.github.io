an [ANU Extension](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/) **H-Course**
for teaching computer science to year 11 & 12 students through making art, music
and other cool things with computers

first student intake this year (applications close Feb 14), first graduates in
2022

the creative arts aren't a way _out_ of computing, they're a way _in_

## today's workshop task

<p class="hl-para" markdown="1">

make a **lesson plan** for exploring a computing concept through creative code

</p>

- you can choose which concept (from e.g. [BSSS
  Frameworks](http://www.bsss.act.edu.au/curriculum/Frameworks), [Australian
  Curriculum](https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/f-10-curriculum/technologies/digital-technologies/),
  [CS concept
  inventories](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=computer%20science%20concept%20inventory),
  [ACS
  CBoK](https://www.acs.org.au/content/dam/acs/acs-documents/The-ACS-Core-Body-of-Knowledge-for-ICT-Professionals-CBOK.pdf),
  or just a concept you know students often struggle with)

- not enough time to make a detailed lesson plan (obvs) but we'll do our
  best---working in groups, hands on, laptops out!

## timeline

| **11:00** | intro & group formation    |
| **11:15** | lesson design task         |
| **12:00** | presentations & discussion |
| **12:30** | lunch 🍣🍔😋               |

## creative computing environments

there are lots, but today we'll focus on these two browser-based (i.e. js)
creative computing environments:

- **p5.js**: <https://p5js.org/> for visuals (using the [web
  editor](https://editor.p5js.org))
- **gibber**: <https://gibber.cc> for sound/music

you're all experienced IT educators, so you can navigate the getting started
guides, examples, etc.

<p style="font-size:0.6em;" markdown="1">

here are some example workshops
([p5.js](https://cs.anu.edu.au/hub/workshops/interpretation-and-code-art/),
[gibber](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/workshops/laptop-music/))
from the c/c/c studio

</p>

## what's the deliverable?

a 2min presentation/demo of your lesson to the rest of this workshop

for scoping, ask yourself:

> what are the _minimal_ notes I'd give to a teacher (that I _like_) 30min
> before having to deliver this lesson to a College IT class?

{% include slides/background-image.html image="documents/ccc-curriculum-design-workshop/joeri-romer-Xne1N4yZuOY-unsplash.jpg" heading="group formation" %}

groups of 2--3

try to find others with similar interests along the music/visuals axis

## discussion questions

1. which computing concept did you choose, why did you choose it, and how (if at
   all) did the "creative" aspect impact that decision?

2. what type of task did you set your students? (convergent, divergent, etc.)

3. how would you assess it---what might the rubric look like?

4. what scaffolding is required to do this in a College IT context?

5. was it _fun_?

(remember, presentations start at 12:00pm)

**presentation time**

## wrap up

thanks so much for participating

I'm keen to:

- make contacts
- get the word out about [ANU Extension Creative Computing](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/creative-computing/)
- be part of a CoP around creative computing for both students and educators

## Bio

Ben is a multidisciplinary researcher and Senior Lecturer in the School of
Computing at the [Australian National
University](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/ben-swift). He's interested in
computational art & music, human-computer interaction, AI/machine learning
(particularly in pursuit of creative ends) and the intersection of code,
creativity and culture as those boundaries dissolve in the modern world. He's
the director of the [code/creativity/culture
studio](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/) within the ANU School of
Computing.

## Bio

He is a [livecoder]({% link livecoding.md %}), and is the vice president of the
[Australasian Computer Music Association](https://computermusic.org.au) (ACMA).
Ben is one of the inaugural [ANU Reimagine Fellows]({% link
_posts/2019-08-30-Im-a-reimagine-fellow.md %}), part of a [$300m+ investment
from the ANU](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/reimagine) charged with re-thinking (and
re-doing) what it is to be a computer scientist in the 21st century.
