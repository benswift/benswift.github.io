My presentation to the [1st International Workshop on Live Programming
(LIVE)](http://liveprogramming.github.io/2013/), part of ICSE '13. This [short
paper]({% link research.md %}#swiftVisualCodeAnnotations2013)
spells out a lot of the ideas that Andrew Sorensen and I were thinking about at
the time (and since). It's only a short paper, so it doesn't cover the topic in
detail, but I think it's still a pretty neat articulation of some of the
thinking behind the Extempore design decisions.
