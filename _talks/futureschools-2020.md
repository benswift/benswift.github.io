title: Teaching code with music and teaching music with code
date: "2020-03-19"

summary: >-
  Software is ubiquitous in modern music production and delivery, but
  usually it's hidden from the musician---a pianist isn't really thinking
  about the DSP code running on their digital piano when they're
  performing.
  
  In this session we flip that script to show how the code itself can be
  the instrument. 'Live coding' is the act of programming (writing code)
  as a musical performance---in front of a live audience. Come along to
  see---and hear!---a live demo of how teaching music and programming
  together can bring your classes to life.
