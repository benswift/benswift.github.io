title: Pop-production as problem-solving
date: "2019-01-11"
permalink: /talks/pop-production/
summary: >-
  Sure, computers are useful for solving problems, but what about when
  creativity is required? How do we solve problems like producing a pop song
  using code? A talk for the [National Youth Science Forum 2019](https://www.nysf.edu.au)

## outline

- [what's a producer?](#pop-production)
- [modelling the domain](#modelling-the-domain)
- [crowdsourced livecoding](#crowdsourced-livecoding)

## what _I'm_ gonna do

- learn a new song (by ear!)
- figure out how to turn it into code
- find a bunch of sounds which sound (approximately) like the recording
- lay down a vocal track (maybe)
- make the whole process make sense to you guys

yikes!

## what _you're_ gonna do

- help me choose the song
- be kind when I make mistakes
- clap politely at the end (even if I flame out)

## what's a producer?

a
[producer](https://www.recordingconnection.com/reference-library/recording-entrepreneurs/what-does-a-music-producer-do/)
is someone who makes songs happen

pop songs are characterised by:

- catchy hooks
- repetitive harmonic patterns (e.g. chord progressions)
- processed/synthetic sounds (lots of computers involved in the production)

**music** _(n.)_

a series of pitched "events" over time

## dimensions of the domain

- time
- pitch
- loudness

## parameterisation

- **time** (in beats), e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- **pitch** (in MIDI note numbers), e.g. middle C as 60, C# as 61, etc.
- **loudness** (0 is silent, 127 is super loud)

## [extempore](https://extemporelang.github.io/): a livecoding _language_

[extempore](https://extemporelang.github.io/) is a programming language designed
for musical livecoding (written [Andrew Sorensen](https://twitter.com/digego)
and [me]({% link index.md %}))

don't worry about the syntax, I'll explain enough for you to follow along

## what did we learn?

pop music isn't black magic, it's a domain with lots of structure/patterns

computers/code are _really useful_ for modelling/exploring this stuff

this is _not_ AI, either
