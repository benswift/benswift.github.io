{% include slides/impact.html %}

what information should flow?

**cui bono**: and for whose benefit?

{% include slides/background-image.html image="images/talks/socy-masters-lecture-workshop-2021/ben-ushini-acmc21-frame.jpg" %}

in watching the video, what did you **pay attention** to, and why? 

what _else_ did you want to know before/during/after?

_(5min breakout rooms)_

hint: later, you'll get to have your say about how to improve things

set design, which is sometimes referred to as scenic design, refers to the
design and creation of the sets used in works of performance art
[(source)](https://www.theartcareerproject.com/careers/set-design/)

pitch me---what should my (and Ushini's) performance setup be?

_(10min breakout rooms, then 10min shareback)_

## some questions to ponder?

- what do K-pop stars/comedians/twitch streamers/DJs/etc. do well?
- what feedback should the _performer_ get?
- where are the feedback **loops**?
- what information should be _hidden_?
- what's the goal? what state should the system steer towards, and how?
- what does cybernetics have to say about all this?

**shareback** time

## what's next?

it's a genuine open question for me (and other livecoders) in their creative
practice

if you'd like to help/collaborate/jam, let me know ðŸ˜Š
