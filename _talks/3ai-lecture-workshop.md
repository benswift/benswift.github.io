title: What can livecoding teach us about cyber-physical systems?
date: "2019-10-01"
permalink: /talks/3ai-lecture-workshop/
summary: >-
  Cyber-physical systems sure are important. But what counts as a CPS? And what
  can they teach us about the things that are important as we design and examine
  CPSs in _all_ areas of life?

  An interactive lecture/presentation/workshop given to the [3a Institute](https://3ainstitute.cecs.anu.edu.au) masters program.

autonomy

~~potatoes~~

assurance

## autonomy

> How do we design for an autonomous world?
>
> This is both a technical set of questions and a philosophical and public
> policy set of questions. Just because we can automate something, should we?
> When we translate human processes into machine processes, what do we need to
> consider?

- where's the **autonomy** in livecoding?
- what does failure look like?
- what design intervention might we make to help out?

## agency

> How much agency do we give technology?
>
> As the ability for machines to act independently of human oversight increases
> with each new tech breakthrough, conversations need to be had about how much
> agency we give to intelligent cyber-physical systems. Are we comfortable with
> machines responding to their environment, and interacting with other machines,
> without a human to check and validate decisions?

- where's the **agency** in livecoding?
- what does failure look like?
- what design intervention might we make to help out?

## assurance

> How do we preserve our safety and values?
>
> Current technological progress calls for new regulatory tools and processes,
> as algorithms designed in different places are introduced into societies
> around the world. The virtual nature of these new goods and services has an
> impact on our ability to regulate their design and use in a way that aligns
> with core cultural values.

- where's the **assurance** in livecoding?
- what does failure look like?
- what design intervention might we make to help out?

there are some "I"s as well as the "A"s

## indicators

> How do we measure performance and success?
>
> Technical systems have typically been measured on their efficiency. However,
> when systems start to learn and change their behaviour over time, the objective
> of efficiency may begin to clash with ideals that have previously been
> implicitly or tacitly inserted into the process by the humans in the loop. How
> do we start to conceptualise building for sustainability, for beauty, for
> values?

- what are the **indicators** in livecoding?
- what does failure look like?
- what design intervention might we make to help out?

## interfaces 

> How will technologies, systems and humans work together?
>
> In previous decades, we interfaced with computational systems through a screen
> and a keyboard. This paradigm is already being disrupted as â€˜smartâ€™ objects
> enter our lives. What will it mean when AI-enabled systems are all around us,
> sensing and responding to us? How to do protect our privacy? What happens to
> all that data?

- what are the **interfaces** in livecoding?
- what does failure look like?
- what design intervention might we make to help out?

## intent

> Why has the system been constructed? by whom? and for what purposes?
>
> It is sometimes tempting to think of a single, monolithic AI. However, AIs
> will be built for different purposes and with very different intentionality,
> and inside different larger systems. Making sense of, and mapping, that
> broader intentionality is central to the emergent new applied science.

- what is the **intent** in livecoding?
- what does failure look like?
- what design intervention might we make to help out?

## open questions

- if/when is a (textual) code interface the best option for balancing
  agency/autonomy/assurance... in livecoding? and beyond?

- what feedback can we provide to help the livecoder stay "on top" of the
  autonomous processes? is that even desirable?

- how does the audience fit in? do they matter? what's _their_ agency?

- when do static analyses help, and when do they get in the way? what about "AI"
  helpers?
