      This is a personal bio page. If you're after a more "researcher-y" bio, have a
      look at my <a href="/research/">research page</a>, or check out my <a href="/cv/">CV</a>.

  <p>
    I'm a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra">Canberra</a> lad, born and bred. One
    day I may move away from this place, but for now I'm here and quite happy about
    it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have one wife, three kids, zero pets, two bikes and two guitars. They all make
    me happy (in monotonically weakly decreasing order).
  </p>

  <p>
    On the weekends I ride my mountain bike, play football (soccer), watch the footy
    (AFL) and cricket and go to church. I'm also trying to learn Mandarin so that I
    can better communicate with my in-laws.
