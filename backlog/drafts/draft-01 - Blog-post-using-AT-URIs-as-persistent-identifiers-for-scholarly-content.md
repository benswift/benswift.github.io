## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Write a blog post exploring the use of AT Protocol URIs as persistent identifiers for blog posts and other scholarly content on the open web.

## Possible angles

- AT-URIs vs DOIs vs bare URLs for citation persistence
- The case for federated, content-addressed identifiers in academic publishing
- Practical walkthrough of how benswift.me integrates standard.site records with citation metadata
- How this fits into the broader "scholarly blogging" and open access conversation
- Limitations and honest assessment of where AT-URIs fall short of DOIs (institutional recognition, resolver infrastructure, etc.)

## Dependencies

Best written after TASK-19 (atproto integration) and TASK-20 (cite component) are done, so the post can reference a working implementation.
