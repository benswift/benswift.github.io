This site uses `::: tip` and `::: info` callout boxes kindof interchangeably...
can you do an audit of all uses and suggest a way to be more conistent about
what counts as a tip vs an info box? Note that the actual "title" can be
overridden by adding more text after the box type, e.g.
`::: tip Watch out for...`.
