I'm a [Canberra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra) lad, born and
bred. One day I may have to move away from this place, but for now I'm
here and quite happy about it.

I have one wife, zero kids, zero pets, three bikes and four guitars. It
seems that in life the sum of *bikes* + *guitars* + *pets* + *kids*
remains constant over time, and that as you get older the bikes and
guitars get sold to make room for the pets and kids. I'm hopeful I'll be
able to keep at least some of my bikes and guitars, but we'll have to
wait and see.

On the weekends I [ride my mountain bike](http://ridecanberra.com.au),
play [football](http://www.capitalfootball.com.au), watch the
[footy](http://www.hawthornfc.com.au) and go to
[church](http://crossroads.asn.au). I'm also trying to learn Mandarin so
that I can better communicate with my in-laws. Ask me how I'm going with
that in a year.
