The [National Invention Convention]({{ page.event_url }}) is an all-expenses
paid, five day workshop at Questacon in Canberra, held every January. This
program gives 25 delegates aged 14-18 from all around Australia the opportunity
to play, make and create with us, designing and developing a prototype that
relates to a theme we give them.

At the end of every event there's both a formal awards ceremony and a dance
party for the participants to let their hair down. In 2018 I was the headline
act at the latter 😊

Alas, no video survives. But many shapes were pulled by the participants.
