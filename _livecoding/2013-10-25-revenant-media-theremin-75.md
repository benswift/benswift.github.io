That's a crowd video from the gig---not always the best viewpoint for looking at
the code.

This gig has a fun backstory (from [ANU Media]({{ page.event_url }})):

> To celebrate UNESCO’s World Day for Audio Visual Media the ANU School of Art
> presents an evening of Revenant Media, two important events bringing old media
> back to life in a new context. In Theremin ’75 a pioneering piece of
> Australian new media, Stanislaus Ostoja-Kotkowski’s theremin of 1975, will be
> played again.

To celebrate, I put together a theremin-inspired livecoding set (with live
visuals inspired by Stan's beautiful theremins).

Because I wanted to show off the visuals (and the above video from the gig
didn't really do that) I "re-recorded" (to the best of my ability to remember)
this set a couple of days later and took a direct screencapture. You don't get
the crowd (sadly) but on the upside the video & audio quality is much nicer.
