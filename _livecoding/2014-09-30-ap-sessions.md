The AP sessions weren't a normal gig. They were a series of livecoding gigs I
performed in 2014 as part of my student [Ari
Purcell's](http://arrianpurcell.com) research project: _Visualising a Live
Coding Arts Process_. Ari developed a bunch of visualisation techniques (in
Extempore) to use in a livecoding performance. They weren't just cool VJ
visuals, they were designed to be overlaid on top of the code.

We developed a two different "types" of visualisations; some were designed
primarily to look cool (_aesthetic_) and some were designed primarily to teach
the audience about what was going on (_didactic_).[^interpretation]

I displayed these visuals (on top of my code) in a couple of livecoding gigs,
and audience members completed a short questionnaire at the end about the
visualisations and their effect on their understanding/enjoyment of the
performance. What this meant is that I was actually trying to do "repeat"
livecoding sets for different audiences---the visuals would change between sets,
so the goal was to make the music itself the same as a "control". Now, because I
can never remember exactly what I did from set to set they weren't exactly the
same, but I tried to make them as similar as possible (for _science_).

I've recently (Feb '19) tracked down the videos from these gigs and uploaded
them to vimeo, both for your enjoyment and also so that when you [read the
paper]({% link research.md %}#purcellVisualisingLiveCoding2014)
you have a better idea what's going on.

We wrote the results of these "experiments" up OzCHI, so you can look up the
paper [in the publications list]({% link research.md
%}#purcellVisualisingLiveCoding2014) if you want to see all the details. Even
better, put the kettle on and read [Arrian's honours
thesis](https://github.com/arrian/research-project/blob/master/thesis/thesis.pdf).

[^interpretation]:
    Obviously these are pretty nebulous concepts, it's not like there's a
    well-defined notion of what an "aesthetic" vs a "didactic" visualisation is.
    And even if there were, it's not necessarily clear that these are the two
    most important aspects of visualisation design. Still, I'm putting the
    videos up here so you can see for yourself what they looked like.

### "Aesthetic" visuals {#aesthetic-visuals}

### "Didactic" visuals

### "Visuals" vs "no visuals" study

Following the "aesthetic vs didactic" gigs, and based on the audience feedback,
Ari developed one more set of visualisation techiniques, and we did one more
gig (with audience feedback like before). This time, there were two sets---one
with the visuals, one without (just the plain code like all my other gigs). Here
are the videos from those sessions. This stuff is all in Chapters 6 and 7 of
[Arrian's honours
thesis](https://github.com/arrian/research-project/blob/master/thesis/thesis.pdf)

The visuals in these recordings are pretty hard to see, and the audio quality's
not great either. However, in the interests of open science, here's video from
the **no visuals** set:

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/315196944?color=be2edd" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

and the video from the **visuals** gig:

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/315199460?color=be2edd" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

## Take-home messages?

If you want some p-values and all that jazz, read the papers. But the broad
take-home is that the visuals helped some, and that visualisations targeting
enjoyment (i.e. aesthetic ones) have a greater benefit than ones which try and
educate people. Basically, work on entertaining people---then their
understanding will flow from that.
