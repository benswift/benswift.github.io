National Science Week is such a great event, with so many activities and events
designed to get folks engaged with science. Each state also holds a "launch
event", where guest speakers kick things off and just generally get everyone
psyched for the coming (science) week.

In 2017 I was invited to perform (alongside ABC weatherman [Nate
Byrne](https://twitter.com/SciNate)) at the launch event to show off the
arts+science possibilities of livecoding. They liked it so much they [invited me
back the next year]({% link
