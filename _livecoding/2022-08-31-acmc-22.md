A livecoding duo set with my collaborator [Ushini
Attanayake](https://ushini.com) for the [2022 Australasian Computer Music
Conference (ACMC'22)](https://www.acmc2022.com/day-one-evening-concert). An
(audio) recording was captured from the desk---I'm in the process of tracking it
down and then I'll post it here.
