As usual, [CECS](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/) kicked off the year with a welcome
party for students & staff old and new. [Kieran](https://kieranbrowne.com) and I
were invited back this year to do a 90min livecoding set---I'm making the music
in [Extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore), he's making the visuals by
writing [OpenGL
shaders](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_on_the_web/GLSL_Shaders).
It was great to be invited to show what's possible we reimagine what humans and
computers can do together.

This was a long set, so there's no recording of the whole event, but here's an
excerpt from about half-way through.
