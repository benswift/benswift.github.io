It was great to perform again at the
[International Conference on Live Coding (ICLC)](https://iclc.toplap.org/2024/program/54.html)[^zenodo]---one
of my favourite events with some of my favourite people.

I (left-hand screen) performed a from-scratch livecoded music set in
[Extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore), with
[Leon Volbers](https://leonvolbers.com/index.html) and Beverly Edwards
(right-hand screen) doing livecoded visuals with their own custom software &
live drawing setup. A big thankyou to the NYU Shanghai team for putting together
the recording.

[^zenodo]:
    There's also a [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/11345213) for this gig
    (with a DOI and everything) for archival purposes.
