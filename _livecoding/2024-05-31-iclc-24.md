It was great to be selected to perform (again) at the
[International Conference on Live Coding (ICLC)](https://iclc.toplap.org/2024/program/54.html).
I performed a from-scratch livecoded music set in
[Extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore), with
[Leon Volbers](https://leonvolbers.com/index.html) and Beverly Edwards doing
livecoded visuals with their own custom software & live drawing setup.

This event was recorded, and the videos
[will be up soon](https://iclc.toplap.org/2024/documentation.html). Once they're
up I'll embed them on this page. There's also a
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/11345213) for this gig (with a DOI and
everything) for archival purposes.
