[Shirty Science](https://shirtyscience.com/) is an ongoing arts/science
collaboration; scientists get paired up with artists to make a sweet t-shirt
explaining/showing off their research.

So of course [Kieran](https://kieranbrowne.com) and I were pumped when they
invited to perform at their Season 3 launch party at [Doughnut Dept.]({{
page.venue_url }})---our very first livecoding set together. I did music, he did
visuals, and we mixed our screens together using our new Roland [V1-HD video
mixer](https://proav.roland.com/global/products/v-1hd/). It was super cool.

Sadly, no photos videos at present---although I'm trying to track some down (if
you were there and have some, [get in touch](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au)).
