This was a really nice gig---the final gig of the day as part of the [You Are
Here (YAH) festival program]({{ page.event_url }}). The screen was projected
onto a bedsheet hanging from the wall, and I think some folks were even there in
their pyjamas. As a result, I went for a "downtempo glitch" vibe. Here are a
couple of photos, no videos have turned up (sadly).
