Here's a list of bios/blurbs that you could use in your glossy brochures. I'm
open to being described/introduced in new ways, too---although if you're going
to do that then I'd appreciate having a discussion with you about it first :)

## General audience (short)

Ben Swift an academic, educator, artist and maker of open source tools for
creative computing. He's always looking for ways to talk about the way that code
(software), creativity (especially the arts) and culture (life) intersect in
today's world.

## Academic (short)

Ben Swift is a multidisciplinary researcher with research interests across
computational art & music, data vis/data science, human-computer interaction,
AI/machine learning, and user experience (UX) design. One broad theme
underpinning his interests in these areas is the potential of _liveness_
(real-time human-in-the-loop interactivity) in programming tools and workflows,
especially in open-ended exploratory programming.

## Academic (long)

{% include blurbs/I-am-paragraphs.md perspective="third" %}

## Livecoder (informal)

Ben Swift is a livecoder and artist-programmer, perpetually struggling to
reconcile his day job in academia with his longing for free and unbridled
artistic expression. He's one half of the core development team for the
[Extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore) programming environment. His
work has been featured on the internet.
