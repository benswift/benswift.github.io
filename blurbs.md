Here's a list of bios/blurbs that you could use in your glossy brochures. I'm
open to being described/introduced in new ways, too---although if you're going
to do that then I'd appreciate having a discussion with you about it first :)

## General audience (short)

Dr. Ben Swift is an academic, educator, artist and maker of open source tools
for creative computing and generative AI. He's a Senior Lecturer at the ANU
School of Cybernetics, where he leads the _Cybernetic Studio_: a cybernetic
community that makes things out of hardware/software/people/stuff to explore
cybernetic systems/ideas and their impact on the world.

## Academic (short)

Dr. Ben Swift is an interdisciplinary scholar and artist-programmer with
interests and expertise in AI/machine learning, computational art & music,
cybernetics, data vis/data science and human-computer interaction. A unifying
thread is the potential of _liveness_ (human-in-the-loop interactivity with
real-time feedback) in tools and workflows, especially in open-ended creative
tasks. He's a Senior Lecturer at the ANU School of Cybernetics, where he leads
the _Cybernetic Studio_: a cybernetic community that makes things out of
hardware/software/people/stuff to explore cybernetic systems/ideas and their
impact on the world.

## Academic (educator)

Dr. Ben Swift is an interdisciplinary scholar and artist-programmer with
interests and expertise in AI/machine learning, computational art & music,
cybernetics, data vis/data science and human-computer interaction. He has
extensive learning and teaching experience in a wide range of contexts, having
worked across two schools at the ANU: the
[School of Computing](https://comp.anu.edu.au) (2012--2021) and the
[School of Cybernetics](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au) (2021--present). He has
designed, convened and taught large courses (e.g. 400+ student core COMP
courses), innovative cross-campus electives (e.g. the ANU Laptop Ensemble), and
extension courses (e.g. the ANU Extension "Creative Computing" H-course). He has
been recognised for his teaching with a 2018 Vice Chancellorâ€™s Citation for
Outstanding Contribution to Student Learning.

He is a previous Associate Director (Education) and team leader for "Exec Ed"
Learning Experiences at the School of Cybernetics. He currently leads the
_Cybernetic Studio_: a cybernetic community that makes things out of
hardware/software/people/stuff to explore cybernetic systems/ideas and their
impact on the world.

## Livecoder (short, informal)

Dr. Ben Swift is a livecoder and artist-programmer, perpetually struggling to
reconcile his day job in academia with his longing to escape into the woods with
a laptop and a solar panel and make beats with code full-time. He's one half of
the core development team for the
[Extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore) programming environment. He
regularly
[performs with Ushini Attanayake as _Funktion_](https://vimeo.com/benswift).

## Explanation of livecoding (general audience)

'Livecoding' is the act of programming (writing code) as a musical
performance---in front of an audience. You can see the code being written in
front of your eyes, and this code is making _all_ the music that you can hear.

It's kindof like conducting an orchestra; but instead of humans in tuxedoes, the
'musicians' are the little bits of code that you can see being written
on-the-fly. They follow the instructions they're given, they play the notes
they're told to, and they never hit bum notes! They're an army of musical robot
ninjas summoned into existence in the improvisational performance of live
coding.

So swing by and try to figure out what's going on; try and understand which
little bits of code are triggering which sounds and notice the way that the
music changes as the code evolves. Or if it all seems too complicated then just
sit back, watch the pretty colours and enjoy listening to the robot ninjas as
they play diligently and tirelessly for your listening pleasure.
