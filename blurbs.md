Here's a list of bios/blurbs that you could use in your glossy brochures. I'm
open to being described/introduced in new ways, too---although if you're going
to do that then I'd appreciate having a discussion with you about it first :)

## General audience (short)

Dr. Ben Swift is an academic, educator, artist and maker of open source tools for creative
computing. He's always looking for ways to talk about the way that code
(software), creativity (especially the arts) and culture (life) intersect in
today's world.

## Academic (short)

Dr. Ben Swift is an interdisciplinary scholar and artist-programmer with interests and
expertise in computational art & music, cybernetics, AI/machine learning, data
vis/data science and human-computer interaction. A unifying thread is the
potential of _liveness_ (human-in-the-loop interactivity with real-time
feedback) in tools and workflows, especially in open-ended creative tasks.

## Academic (long)

## Livecoder (short, informal)

Dr. Ben Swift is a livecoder and artist-programmer, perpetually struggling to
reconcile his day job in academia with his longing for free and unbridled
artistic expression. He's one half of the core development team for the
[Extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore) programming environment. His
work has been featured on the internet.

## Explanation of livecoding (general audience)

'Livecoding' is the act of programming (writing code) as a musical
performance---in front of an audience. You can see the co e being written in
front of your eyes, and this code is making _all_ the music that you can hear.

It's kindof like conducting an orchestra; but instead of humans in tuxedoes, the
'musicians' are the little bits of code that you can see being written
on-the-fly. They follow the instructions they're given, they play the notes
they're told to, and they never hit bum notes! They're an army of musical robot
ninjas summoned into existence in the improvisational performance of live
coding.

So swing by and try to figure out what's going on; try and understand which
little bits of code are triggering which sounds and notice the way that the
music changes as the code evolves. Or if it all seems too complicated then just
sit back, watch the pretty colours and enjoy listening to the robot ninjas as
they play diligently and tirelessly for your listening pleasure.
