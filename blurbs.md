Here's a list of bios/blurbs that you could use in your glossy brochures. I'm
open to being described/introduced in new ways, too---although if you're going
to do that then I'd appreciate having a discussion with you about it first :)

## General audience (short)

Ben is an academic, educator, artist and maker of open source tools for creative
computing. He's always looking for ways to talk about the way that code
(software), creativity (especially the arts) and culture (life) intersect in
today's world.

## Academic (short)

Ben is an interdisciplinary scholar with interests and expertise in
computational art & music, cybernetics, AI/machine learning, data vis/data
science and human-computer interaction. A unifying thread is the potential of
_liveness_ (human-in-the-loop interactivity with real-time feedback) in tools
and workflows, especially in open-ended creative tasks.

## Academic (long)

{% include blurbs/I-am-paragraphs.md perspective="third" %}

## Livecoder (short, informal)

Ben Swift is a livecoder and artist-programmer, perpetually struggling to
reconcile his day job in academia with his longing for free and unbridled
artistic expression. He's one half of the core development team for the
[Extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore) programming environment. His
work has been featured on the internet.
