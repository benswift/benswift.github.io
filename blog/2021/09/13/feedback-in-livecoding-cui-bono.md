[link to the slides](/blog/2021/09/13/feedback-in-livecoding-cui-bono) for the
actual presentation on Oct 13. :::

Hi, BUILD students. I know y'all are busy, so this won't take _too_ long and
will hopefully be fun. Before my guest lecture, I'd like to introduce you (if
you haven't seen it before) to [livecoding](https://toplap.org/about/). Imagine
you arrive at the club[^pingers], and as well as the glow sticks and the pingers
and the heaving bodies on the dance floor instead of a "traditional" DJ you see
this:

[^pingers]:
    I don't really have any lived experience with this---I'm approaching 40 and
    have young kids and I'm normally in bed by 9:30pm.

## What can cybernetics teach us about this?

Obviously there are lots of feedback loops in this CPS; involving
audience/room/livecoder/screens/lights/loudspeakers etc. But one of the things
that interests me most about livecoding is that it gives the club-goers a chance
to see (and hopefully to _care_) about the source code of a computer program.

There's lots we could say about this from a cybernetics perspective, but the
things I want to focus on in this class is _feedback_.

Here are a few questions for you to think about ahead of class. In each
livecoding video:

- what has the performer chosen to _show_?
- what has the performer chosen to _hide_?
- who is the feedback _for_[^cui]?
- in each case, why do you think those decisions were made?
- when watching, what did _you_ want more/less/different feedback about?
- if you were the AV designer for [Ushini](https://ushini.com) & my next
  livecoding set, what changes would you make?
- how does a taking a cybernetic approach to this question change answer to
  these questions? (because feedback is something that cybernetics has a fair
  bit to say about)

[^cui]: Hence the pretentious latin in the title of this blog post.

If you want to go a bit deeper on the semiotics of all this livecoding stuff, my
collaborators and I have written a couple of papers[^gauche] on the
semantics/semiotics of livecoding:

- Swift, B., Sorensen, A., Gardner, H., & Hosking, J. (2013).
  [Visual Code Annotations for Cyberphysical Programming](https://doi.org/10.1109/LIVE.2013.6617345).
  _LIVE '13: 1st International Workshop on Live Programming at ICSE_, 27–30.

- Sorensen, A., Swift, B., & Riddell, A. (2014).
  [The Many Meanings of Live Coding](https://doi.org/10.1162/COMJ_a_00230).
  _Computer Music Journal_, 38(1), 65–76.

If there are other thinkers/writers/doers that you can think of who also have
something to say about this, then bring those ideas along and we can discuss
them as well.

[^gauche]: I hope it's not too gauche to provide _two_ self-citations.
