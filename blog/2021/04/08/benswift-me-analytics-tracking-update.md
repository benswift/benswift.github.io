I haven't had any sort of client-side analytics (e.g. Google Analytics) on
`benswift.me` for a _long_ time (since around 2012 I think---several iterations
of the site ago). I use an ad-blocker myself, and the whole tracking & analytics
thing just strikes me as a bit gross.

However, it is helpful to know where folks are coming from, and so I recently
came across [https://counter.dev](https://counter.dev) as a lightweight,
relatively un-invasive tracking platform. So I've added it to the site. If
you're browsing with an ad-blocker then you still have my blessing to enjoy the
stuff I put up here ☺

Just wanted to give y'all the heads up. Let me know what you think in the
comments[^comments].

    Just kidding, who has the time to moderate comments on a personal webpage
    these days? If you want to get in touch, email me or write something on your
    own blog and link me to it---there are lots of ways to have conversations,
    and I'm keen to have them.
