Great news on the local computer music conference front: the [Australian
Institute of Music](https://aim.edu.au) is hosting the
[ACMC](https://computermusic.org.au) conference in Sydney/Melbourne/online at
the end of August '21. I'll be there---and if you're a
computers-and-music-adjacent artist then you should think about submitting a
paper, artist talk or performance as well.

If you're not sure if this is your scene, then I'd [love to chat to
you](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au) and convince you that it might be---we're
trying to remove the stuffy academic stigma that sometimes hangs around
conferences like this (and also making it super-cheap for indies to attend).

For more details, see the [conference website](https://www.acmc21.art).
