# CHI hangs




Here's a photo of Kieran and I hanging out at CHI. I'll write a more detailed
trip report some other time, but from the general chats I had with people (and
random [unsolicited blog
posts](https://eagereyes.org/blog/2018/seven-visualization-talks-that-terrified-me-at-chi))
it seems like [the ritual](/blog/2018/04/24/the-other-side-algorithm-as-ritual-in-artificial-intelligence) started some conversations.
