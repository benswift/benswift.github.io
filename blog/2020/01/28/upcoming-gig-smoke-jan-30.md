::: info Update

The [video is now online](/livecoding/2020-01-30-smoke)---thanks to Charles for
putting it together.

:::

If you're in Canberra this Thursday Jan 30 then you should come to a (free) gig
that the c/c/c studio is putting on in the
[Peter Karmel](https://www.anu.edu.au/maps#show=29113) Big Band room (at the ANU
School of Music).

Get away from the
[fires & smoke](https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6600587/namadgi-fire-now-at-2575ha-total-fire-ban-declared/)[^fires]
and come see an evening of experimental sounds in processed voice, livecoding,
and neural networks with musicians from the ANU code/creativity/culture studio
and special guest [Fiona Sullivan](https://www.fisounds.com) (USA). There's a
[FB event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/541225126490467/) as well if
you're into that sort of thing.

- **time**: 5:45pm--7pm
- **location** Big Band Room,
  [Peter Karmel Building](https://www.anu.edu.au/maps#show=29113), ANU School of
  Music
- **cost**: free

Here's the setlist:

If you're wondering when I'm on, I'm the "B" in FBK, alongside Kieran and Fiona.

[^fires]:
    I know that you can't get away from them; and the loss of flora & fauna is
    heartbreaking, not to mention the human cost.

Kieran will be livecoding visuals in GLSL, Charles will be (very musically!)
fighting with his AI, I'll be dropping beats in Extempore and Fi will be
_amazing_. See you there.

Note: if you've never been there before, the
[Peter Karmel building](https://www.anu.edu.au/maps#show=29113) is the one next
to the "main" ANU School of Music building. The Big Band room is off the
foyer/atrium, right near the main entrance.
