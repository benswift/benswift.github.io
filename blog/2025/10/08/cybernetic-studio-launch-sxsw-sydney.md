# Cybernetic Studio Launch @ SXSW Sydney




I'm launching the
[**Cybernetic Studio**](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/cybernetic-studio/) next
week (Oct 15) at [SXSW Sydney](https://www.sxswsydney.com). If you're attending,
come to Chippendale on Wednesday afternoon (search for
[_Cybernetic Studio Launch_ in the SXSW app](https://www.sxswsydney.com/lineup?date=2025-10-15&showSession=781823)
for details) and see what we've been building.

The Cybernetic Studio is a lab-style initiative exploring responsible innovation
through creative, embodied approaches to technology. Which is a fancy way of
saying: we build things to think with[^making-to-think], and we try to do it in
ways that don't just reproduce the surveillance capitalism playbook. Nam Jun
Paik used technology in order to hate it properly, the Studio aims to carry on
that noble tradition.

[^making-to-think]:
    This is the core of research-through-practice---you can't think your way to
    understanding complex sociotechnical systems, you have to build them and
    watch how they fail.

The launch project is "Human Scale AI"---an attempt to slow computations down
and blow them up so we can actually see them at work. Two artefacts I'll be
showing:

- **Perceptron Apparatus**: a 1.2 metre diameter wooden table that functions as
  an "Abacus for AI". Is it an abacus? Is it an ouija board? No, it's a physical
  device capable of performing the Artificial Neural Network calculations that
  underpin all of modern AI. The apparatus can actually perform real AI tasks
  (e.g. image recognition, data classification) if you have a _lot_ of time and
  a willingness to multiply numbers using concentric wooden rings. It's part
  séance, part computational theatre, part "explainable AI", and asks where the
  "intelligence" lives when the computation is distributed across human
  operators and a wooden table.

- **My First LM**: a hands-on activity where you build and use a language model
  with paper grids, dice, and children's books. You manually create word
  co-occurrence grids (the training phase), then use dice to sample from those
  distributions to generate new text (the prediction phase). It's remarkably
  effective at teaching the train-predict-sample cycle---people get it in a way
  that no amount of explaining "transformers" or "attention mechanisms" ever
  achieves. The activity scales up through different ideas in Large Language
  Models---bigram/trigram models, embedding vectors, alternative sampling
  procedures, even LoRAs---to show how the same model can behave differently
  depending on how you use it.[^demystification]

[^demystification]:
    There's a particular kind of technical literacy I'm after here. Not
    "everyone should learn to code", but rather "everyone should have access to
    mental models that aren't just anthropomorphic vibes about what AI wants or
    thinks."

Both pieces are about materiality and scale. Can you understand something
differently when you can touch it, when it operates at human perception speed,
when you can see all the moving parts at once? I suspect yes, but that's what
the studio is for---figuring out what actually works.

The event is hosted with Dr. Cath Ball, who always brings the juice. Should be
good conversations.

It's ticketed, but if you're a SXSW badge-holder you you can register via the
app. Come along, have a few drinks on us, see some interesting human-scale AI
artefacts, have some interesting conversations about where this is all heading.
