New Cybernetic Studio project announcement: the **APS AI Transparency Tracker**
([GitHub link](https://github.com/ANUcybernetics/aps-ai-transparency-tracker)).

From the README:

> This repository tracks **AI Transparency Statements** from Australian
> Government agencies.
>
> A _Cybernetic Studio_ project by [Ben Swift](https://benswift.me).
>
> ## Background
>
> Under the
> [Policy for the responsible use of AI in government](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/policy),
> all Australian Government agencies are required (since Feb 28 2025) to publish
> AI Transparency Statements on their websites. These statements must be updated
> at least annually.
>
> In the [spirit](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress) of
> [similar](https://github.com/bundestag/gesetze) >
> [attempts](https://github.com/DCCouncil/dc-law) to
> [track](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-education-state-policy-tracking) >
> [policy](https://github.com/openaustralia/theyvoteforyou) and
> [law](https://github.com/openaustralia/openaustralia-parser) >
> [changes](https://github.com/isaacus-dev/open-australian-legal-corpus-creator) >
> [using](https://github.com/k-r-a-s-s/aus-govt-transparency) >
> [version](https://github.com/aclu-national/tracking-ll144-bias-audits) >
> [control](https://github.com/Cybersoft82/Privacy-Policy-Change-Detection-and-History-Tracking-Service)
> tools,
> [this project](https://github.com/ANUcybernetics/aps-ai-transparency-tracker)
> automatically scrapes these statements and stores them as markdown files with
> YAML frontmatter, allowing changes to be tracked over time through git. The
> list of agencies is from
> [the APSC](https://www.apsc.gov.au/aps-agencies-size-and-function) with
> acronyms cross-referenced from
> [PM&C](https://www.pmc.gov.au/resources/abbreviations-and-acronyms-groups-or-topics).

I'll leave it running and we'll get to see how these statements evolve over
time. Stay tuned!
