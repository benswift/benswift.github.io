Code has always felt rigid to me. Brittle, even. Most of the ways you poke,
prod, or change it will break it. And even when you know what you're
doing---when you're making a change that's unambiguously a good one---you often
need to break it in one place and then manually fix it up in a dozen others to
compensate.

This is the essential character of code, I thought. It's precise, so it's
fragile. That's the deal.

With Claude Code and other coding agents, it feels different. I talk to the
codebase in natural language, and it *deforms* but ends up still working (most
of the time). It's not that there aren't a heap of intermediate steps where the
agent runs the change-observe-fix loop---there are---but it usually doesn't
require my intervention. So the overall feeling is of code that bends but
doesn't break.
