AI language models have advanced to the point where they can generate text that
is convincing and difficult to distinguish from human-generated content. This
has led to the rise of AI-generated bullshit, which is defined as text that is
designed to deceive or manipulate without providing any real information or
value.

Brandolini's law states that the amount of energy necessary to refute bullshit
is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it. In other words, the main
problem with AI-generated bullshit is not that it will be factually incorrect,
but that educators will be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of it.

Better AI-generated bullshit detection tools might seem like the solution, but
it is likely to be an endless arms race between the bullshit generators and the
detectors. Instead, our society needs to get better at dealing with bullshit at
scale.

One way to do this is to teach our students how to recognize and evaluate the
quality of written content. This not only helps them avoid being deceived by
AI-generated bullshit, but also enables them to become more discerning consumers
of information in general. Educators can also play a role by partnering with
students to generate and detect bullshit, and by providing guidance on how to
navigate the overwhelming amount of information available today.

In conclusion, the use of AI-generated bullshit in higher education is becoming
more common and presents both benefits and drawbacks. By being aware of its
existence and potential impact, educators and students can make informed
decisions about its use and work towards building a society that is better
equipped to deal with bullshit at scale.

Let's try again. The three points I want to make are:

1. AI language models are now at a point where they can generate convincing
   bullshit (here I'm using bullshit in the technical sense, following Harry
   Frankfurt) with minimal human effort
2. Brandolini's law tells us that the main problem here isn't that the text will
   be wrong, but that educators will be overwhelmed.
3. Better AI-generated bullshit detection tools aren't the answer, because it'll
   always be an arms race between the bullshit generators and the bullshit
   detectors.
4. What's clear is that our society needs to get better at dealing with bullshit
   at scale, and fast. And this is what we should be teaching our students.
   Which means we get to partner with them in generating the bullshit, but also
   training them to recognise it (and become more discerning consumers of
   information in the process).

Can you write the above points into an article for a general audience?

_this was the initial one_

I need to write an article on the use of AI-generated bullshit in higher
education. I'm not interested in saying either "this is amazing" or "this is
terrible". The points I want to make are:

1. AI language models are now at a point where they can generate convincing
   bullshit (here I'm using bullshit in the technical sense, following Harry
   Frankfurt) with minimal human effort The use of AI-generated bullshit in
   higher education is becoming more common There are potential benefits and
   drawbacks to using AI-generated bullshit in higher education It is important
   for educators and students to be aware of the existence and potential impact
   of AI-generated bullshit in order to make informed decisions about its use In
   recent years, AI language models have advanced to the point where they can
   generate text that is convincing and difficult to distinguish from
   human-generated content. This has led to the rise of AI-generated bullshit,
   which is defined as text that is designed to deceive or manipulate without
   providing any real information or value.

One area where AI-generated bullshit is gaining popularity is higher education.
In some cases, educators are using AI tools to generate papers and other written
assignments that are indistinguishable from human-generated content. This can
save time and effort for both students and educators, but it also raises ethical
concerns.

On the one hand, AI-generated bullshit has the potential to be a valuable tool
in higher education. By automating the production of written assignments, it can
free up time for educators and students to focus on more important tasks, such
as research and critical thinking. It can also help students learn to identify
and evaluate the quality of written content, which is an important skill in the
digital age.

On the other hand, there are also potential drawbacks to using AI-generated
bullshit in higher education. For one thing, it can be used to cheat on exams
and assignments, undermining the integrity of the education system. It can also
lead to a proliferation of low-quality content that does not provide any real
value or knowledge.

It is important for educators and students to be aware of the existence and
potential impact of AI-generated bullshit in higher education. By understanding
the potential benefits and drawbacks of using AI tools to generate written
content, they can make informed decisions about whether and how to use these
tools in their own work. It is also important for educators to develop
strategies for detecting and dealing with AI-generated bullshit, in order to
maintain the integrity of the education system and ensure that students are
learning valuable information and skills.
