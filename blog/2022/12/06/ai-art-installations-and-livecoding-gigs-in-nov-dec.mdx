If you [follow me on bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/benswift.me) you've seen
this already, but over the last couple of months I've been hard at work on an AI
art installation called Panic. This was a collaboration with
[Adrian Schmidt](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/people/adrian-schmidt/)---I did
the software, he did the hardware (including the cool, 6" diameter _Panic!_
button).

I wrote
[an essay on the School of Cybernetics website](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/news/2022/11/22/panic-a-serendipity-engine/)
which goes into more detail about how it works and what it all means (I mean,
it's an artwork, so mostly I built it because I could, but some folks wanna know
"what's the practical application of this stuff" so I wrote some words to give
plausible deniability).

Here's a 90min video of every single stable-diffusion image generated over the
full 2 weeks of the exhibition. Not necessarily the sort of thing you'd sit down
and watch from start to finish, but fun to dip in and out of. Even at 8fps it's
still possible to watch the gestalt change over time (and it's also interesting
to see which prompts the humans in the room put in).

On the livecoding front, [Ushini](https://ushini.com) & I did another
[livecoding set at the OzCHI 2022 conference](https://www.ozchi.org/2022/creative_4.html)---pics
& video on the [livecoding page](/livecoding/2022-12-01-ozchi-22).
