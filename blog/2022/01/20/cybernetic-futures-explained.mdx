::: info

One of my current projects at the ANU School of Cybernetics is to develop tools
& procedures for futuring. This post is an attempt to get my head around how
these things fit together (spoiler: they do!).

## Futures

Futures/futuring[^terminology] is _a thing_---see
[Smith and Ashby](https://www.howtofuture.com) for a practical guide or
[Powers](https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=p084690) for a more critical
history and review. It's the idea and practice of futuring as a verb, and this
video from the [Institute for the Future](https://www.iftf.org) is a good
articulation of the "pitch":

[^terminology]:
    or foresight, or forecasting... there are a few terms which are used
    relatively interchangeably

Just so I'm clear up-front: I think that futuring is a genuinely useful tool in
the toolbelt of any individual or organisation trying to figure out what success
looks like and how to achieve it.

One diagram which is often used in futuring is the
[futures cone](https://thevoroscope.com/publications/foresight-primer/), which
helps visualise the relationship between the _now_ and the different potential
_futures_ which might eventuate.

![The futures cone](/assets/images/posts/cybernetic-futures/futures-cone.webp)

This diagram is just a visual aid---the future doesn't really exist as a series
of concentric discs of soothing colours---but it helps to anchor discussions we
might have and predictions we might make about the future. In this sense, any
prediction or "vision" of the future is a single **point** in the futures cone,
and exactly where it falls in the space of possible, plausible, probable, or
preferable futures is part of the discussion. Think about it as
[monte carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) of the future:

![An example distribution of potential futures in the futures cone](/assets/images/posts/cybernetic-futures/futures-sampling.webp)

One thing to note here is that futuring is not about predicting the future. In
many ways it makes one less certain about the future; futuring requires a
healthy dose of epistemic humility, but that's ok. It's hard to expect the
unexpected and predict the unpredictable, so these sampled points (potential
futures) are really just a way of thinking about the current state of the world,
and especially how we might act and position ourselves in the world now to make
the most of future opportunities and steer towards the more desirable potential
futures.

## Cybernetics

[Stafford Beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer) tells a joke about
defining cybernetics in
[an address he gave at the University of Valladolid](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/03684920210417283/):

> ...it concerns three men who are about to be executed. The prison governor
> calls them to his office, and explains that each will be granted a last
> request. The first one confesses that he has led a sinful life, and would like
> to see a priest. The governor says he thinks he can arrange that. And the
> second man? The second man explains that he is a professor of cybernetics. His
> last request is to deliver a final and definitive answer to the question: what
> is cybernetics? The governor accedes to this request also. And the third man?
> Well, he is a doctoral student of the professor---his request is to be
> executed second.

It's a great joke, grounded in a deep truth. One way to define cybernetic
systems is as systems with (i) a purpose/goal and (ii) a mechanism for steering
towards[^towards] said purpose. In some cases there's a defined end state, where
upon attaining said purpose victory is declared and the job is done. However in
many cases what's desirable is
[homeostasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis), i.e. a system which
can keep itself "in its happy place", stable and resistant to peturbations.

[^towards]:
    The system's purpose can also be stated negatively, e.g. avoiding pain. So
    towards/away from are equally valid when talking about purpose.

![A lighthouse on the shore](/assets/images/posts/cybernetic-futures/evgeni-tcherkasski-SHA85I0G8K4-unsplash.webp)

There are lots of potential illustrations of this idea, but one that many of my
cybernetic forebears liked is the one of using a lighthouse to steer a ship.
[Here's](https://history-computer.com/the-complete-guide-to-cybernetics/) a nice
explanation:

> In ancient Greece, the
> [_Kubernetes_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics#Etymology) >
> [navigator/helmsperson] was in charge of controlling the Grecian longships.
> The ships had to be steered through all kinds of unpredictable forces,
> including wind, waves, storms, currents, and tides. The Greeks found that they
> could ignore all of these and control the ship via a small tiller connected to
> the ship's larger rudder just by pointing the tiller toward a fixed object in
> the distance, such as a lighthouse, and making adjustments in real-time.

There's a
[YouTube "What is cybernetics?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXmlbd86YGA)
video which includes a diagram like this:

![Diagram of the kubernetes' steering procedure](/assets/images/posts/cybernetic-futures/kubernetes-steering-procedure.webp)

It's not the particular position of the tiller at any one time that's important,
is the way that the navigator watches the lighthouse and moves the tiller in
response (as the ship is affected by currents & winds). If the ship's bow is
pointing to one side of the lighthouse, then adjust the tiller in the opposite
direction until it does. If you keep up that simple procedure, you'll get there
in the end, and with your ship in one piece.

It's the navigator's continued monitoring of the difference between the
purpose/goal (as indicated by the lighthouse) and the current state (as
indicated by the where the bow is pointing) which matters. Once you know how to
respond to that difference, by steering in the opposite direction of that
difference, then you've got a simple and reliable procedure for successful
sailing.

Here's the key point: cybernetic systems don't work by planning out a complex,
go-to-whoa list of actions to take and then mindlessly following them. Instead
they use a simpler process involving _feedback_: do a thing,
looking/listening/sense what happened, compare the new state of the world with
the goal, and then do another thing... and so on[^all-encompassing].

[^all-encompassing]:
    If that definition sounds all-encompassing, you're not the first person to
    notice that. Cybernetics
    [isn't shy](https://www.pangaro.com/cybernetics-the-center-of-sciences-future.html)
    about claiming all things as within its purview---Wiener was an ersatz
    theologian.

![A radar dish](/assets/images/posts/cybernetic-futures/remy-gieling-n_QECf2Qm4E-unsplash.webp)

Here's another example of a feedback-powered system. The development of radar in
WWII was deeply connected to the birth of cybernetics (as detailed by Thomas Rid
in [Rise of the Machines](https://wwnorton.com/books/Rise-of-the-Machines/)
Chapter 1). Take it away, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar):

The radar sends out the pulses, which bounce (reflect) off the environment---and
these these reflections are sufficient (with some
[tricky maths](https://nato-us.org/analysis2000/papers/moran.pdf)) to figure out
what the environment looks like. Often there's some sort of visual
representation of the results, like the classic "beeping dots on concentric
circles" radar sweep interface you'll know from the movies.

The radar example is different from the ship steering one in that lighthouses
don't really move/change (although the currents in the water & other
environmental factors do... hence the need for the feedback-powered steering
procedure). Using the radar properly requires sending an ongoing series of
pulses, because they each give an indication of what the environment looked like
when the pulses were reflected, but to track moving objects you need to monitor
the dots over time to see how the environment changes.

## Cybernetic futures

Returning to futuring; each future scenario you can imagine (regardless of where
it falls in the futures cone) is a way of projecting a potential "end state".
That end state doesn't have to be desirable---many potential futures
aren't---but it gives a "concrete" thing against which to compare your current
state to inform your current actions. Even the more mundane acts of management
and oversight---strategy, tactics, contingency planning---when done well they
all involve articulating goals and thinking about ways to bring them about.
There's clearly an echo of the "steering systems" thing here.

However, one pitfall of that sort of mental picture of the future is that
futuring looks like a three step process:

1. come up with (sample) a bunch of potential futures from the futures cone (the
   points in the diagram above)
2. pick one of the potential futures you like the most (from the _preferable_
   area of the futures cone)
3. steer towards[^lighthouse-steering] it like a lighthouse (whatever that looks
   like)

[^lighthouse-steering]:
    Yeah, I know, you don't steer towards the lighthouse exactly---they just
    [show you where the rocks and reefs are](https://adventure.howstuffworks.com/lighthouse.htm).
    Don't @ me.

![Steering towards a preferred future](/assets/images/posts/cybernetic-futures/steering-towards-preferred-future.webp)

That's an unhelpful picture of what futuring is because it implies that the
potential future you're steering towards is solid & stationary, but that's just
not how potential futures work. Instead, I think that futuring works best when
it's more like a radar:

1. come up with (sample) a bunch of potential futures from the futures cone
   (send out radar pulses)
2. look for their reflections in the present
3. analyse these reflections to decide how to act
4. goto step 1 (because things have now changed)

![Futuring as a radar](/assets/images/posts/cybernetic-futures/futures-as-radar.webp)

As well as giving a different mental model of what futuring is and isn't, I
think there are two implications of this switch in perspective.

1. Just like a ship drifts on the currents, our orientation to these potential
   futures is constantly changing as we & others act in the present---we're
   agents; we have agency. So we need to constantly re-examine our orientation
   towards these multiple futures and reorient ourselves as a result. That's a
   "radar-like" model of futuring. Cybernetics doesn't provide a "once you
   measure & model all the things you can predict the future" silver bullet
   (although it's not like some folks haven't tried
   [and failed](https://eujournalfuturesresearch.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s40309-013-0029-y)),
   but rather it's a commitment to using a simple "sense-analyze-act" feedback
   loop to keep the system on track.

1. Don't be fooled by the simplicity of the steering procedure in the
   ship/lighthouse example; the radar example shows that making sense of the
   feedback from the environment can require non-trivial analysis before it's
   useful.

To close, I want to stress that I'm not saying anything remotely new here about
the connection between futuring and cybernetics---they're very often seen &
discussed together. William Gibson, award-winning sci-fi novelist and sometime
futurist was
[steeped in cybernetic lore](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/magazine/19wwln-q4-t.html)
when he
[coined the term "cyberspace"](https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/08/26/how-william-gibson-coined-cyberspace/).
My boss
[Genevieve Bell AO](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/people/genevieve-bell/),
director of the [ANU School of Cybernetics](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au), has
thought deeply and written persuasively and generally projected big futuring
energy for pretty much her whole career.
