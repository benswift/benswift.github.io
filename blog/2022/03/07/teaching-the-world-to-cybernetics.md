If you're the sort of person who lurks on people's LinkedIn accounts, you may
have noticed that I've recently become the [lead of the _Experiences_
Team](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/people/ben-swift/) at the School of
Cybernetics. My team's mission is:

> to take Cybernetics to the world by providing encounters with cybernetics to
> individuals and organisations who are (currently) not in our Masters/PhD
> programs.
>
> ...and to find ways to do it sustainably.

That might strike you as a pretty broad mission, for a couple of reasons:

- what counts as an _encounter_? couldn't that be anything?
- the world is a big and diverse place

...and you'd be right. If you follow the rest of the communications from the
School of Cybernetics you'll know that we're not shy about painting a grand,
totalising vision of how the world can/might work and what part cybernetics has
to play in it. And while I'm a bit daunted by the task, I'm also pretty excited.

Here are some of the things my team will be working on over the next weeks/months/years:

- site-specific experiences based around specific places; uncovering the
  cybernetic histories of some of the places we inhabit on the ANU campus and
  beyond, and creating narrative experiences to share those histories with
  others
  
- articulating many different answers to the question "what is cybernetics?" for
  different audiences & mediums (online/in-person, talks/workshops/happenings,
  prosaic/poetic)

- creating a curriculum for interested partners to understand how the key ideas
  of cybernetics can help them untagle (or at least manage) the complexity in
  their businesses and other organisations
  
What I can say is that I want the things we make to be **weird**. If I ever turn
up in a tie and a blue suit and deliver an hours-long bullet-pointed PowerPoint
presentation[^ppt] on this stuff then you have my permission to point me back to
this post and ask me where it all went wrong. Otherwise, I look forward to
crossing paths with you and sharing an educational experience about cybernetics.

[^ppt]:
    Don't get me wrong, PowerPoint (well, visual aids in general) can be super
    effective as part of a multimedia presentation strategy, but the
    [affordances of the tool are such that it makes it hard to avoid the
    pitfalls](https://twitter.com/add_hawk/status/1489001635779018754).
