I'm trying to find all the photos of me doing livecoding gigs over the past 10
years. If you've got an old photo of me doing my thing, then can you
[email](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au) me to share it? I'll give you authoreal
credit and hugs.

For any photos of actual gigs, they'll go into the [livecoding](/livecoding/)
section of this website. However, I also do lots of other presentations, talks
and demos which don't really count as "gigs". For those, I'll just add the
photos here as they turn up.

This isn't me _performing_, unless you count my animated conversation with
Gordon Monro as a performance.
