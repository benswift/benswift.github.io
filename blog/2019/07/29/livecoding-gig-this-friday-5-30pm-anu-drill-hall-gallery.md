For those who visit my blog to hear my livecoding gigs, there's one this Friday.
If you wanna see me perform with [Charles Martin](https://charlesmartin.com.au/)
(on percussion & electronics) and [Kieran Browne](https://kieranbrowne.com) on
livecoded visuals (live GLSL shader hacking). We're playing 5:30pm--7:30pm @
[Drill Hall Gallery](https://dhg.anu.edu.au/) as part of the
[_Ildiko Kovacs: The DNA of colour_ exhibition](https://dhg.anu.edu.au/events/ildiko-kovacs-the-dna-of-colour/).

Also on the bill are current & former members of the
[ANU Laptop Ensemble](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/lens/),
including [Ushini Attanayake](https://ushini.com) and Brent Schuetze.

Free entry! Light refreshments provided, drinks from $5. You really don't have
any reason not to come along 😉
