I'm now a [Reimagine Fellow](/blog/2019/08/30/Im-a-reimagine-fellow) and stuff
to do with that program (and getting the
[c/c/c studio](/blog/2019/03/20/reimagine-fellow-project-pitch) up and running)
is starting to happen. As I've
[done](/blog/2019/02/07/reimagining-engineering-cs-at-the-anu)
[so far](/blog/2019/03/20/reimagine-fellow-project-pitch) I'm planning to
continue to work on this project "in the open", i.e. on this blog. This means
that if you've got ideas or want to help out, you can see where I'm up to (and
[get in touch](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au)), and it also minimises the
likelihood that I'll be forced to email around anything called
`project-plan-final-ACTUALLY-FINAL-v3.docx` 😉.

In preparation for a Reimagine Fellows workshop this week (Thursday
September 12) I'm sketching out all the existing stuff that's happening on- (and
off-) campus relating to the c/c/c studio. This is all really rough, but it's a
place to collect the thoughts & names in my head.
