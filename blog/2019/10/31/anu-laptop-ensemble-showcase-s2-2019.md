Last weekend the S2 2019
[LENS](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/lens/) cohort (the ANU
Laptop Ensemble) gave their final performances as part of the ANU School of
Music's composition showcase. Thanks to everyone who attended, and congrats
again to the students who learned a bunch of computer music stuff &
build/composed and performed a working piece in one crazy semester. And an
especially big thanks to my LENS co-directors
[Charles](https://charlesmartin.com.au/) and
[Alec](https://music.cass.anu.edu.au/people/dr-alexander-hunter).

There were more talented photographers than I present (and I'll put those photos
& videos up when I track them down) but here are some photos I snapped of the
performances:

the LENS members even stayed around afterwards to help us bump out:

LENS will be back again in S1 2019, so if you're interested then
[shoot me an email](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au) and we can keep you in the loop
about how to be involved.
