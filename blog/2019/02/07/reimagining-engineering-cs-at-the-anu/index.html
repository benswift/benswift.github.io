  <p>The <a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au">ANU College of Engineering and Computer Science</a>
(CECS) is being <em>Reimagined</em>. Don‚Äôt take my word for it; listen to our fearless
leader <a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au">Elanor</a>:</p>

<section class="center" style="clear:both;">

  

  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FjlgEZzaL6k" style="display:block; margin:0 auto; width:50vw; height:50vh;" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="">
  </iframe>

</section>

<p>Basically, this <a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au/reimagine">Reimagine project</a> is a
<em>huge</em> investment from the ANU for CECS to grow, change, and to skate to where
the puck is going to be in 2050 (technologically, societally, culturally, and
more).</p>

<p>The search is on within CECS to identify <strong>Reimagine Fellows</strong> to champion
various parts of this transformation. This is super-exciting, especially for
interdisciplinary art/design/technology folks (like me). It‚Äôd be exciting if it
was happening <em>anywhere</em>, but it‚Äôs particularly exciting that it‚Äôs happening
where I am and that I might get a voice in shaping exactly what a ‚Äúreimagined
CECS‚Äù looks like.</p>

<p class="hl-para">Elanor, if you‚Äôre reading, I want to be a Reimagine Fellow (<a href="/blog/2019/08/30/Im-a-reimagine-fellow/">update 30 Aug 2019:
üôåü•≥üôå</a>).
And since the
<a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au/staff/project-reimagine-fellows-expression-interest">EoI</a>
asked for ‚Äú1000 words <strong>in any format you like</strong>‚Äù, here‚Äôs mine in the form of an
FAQ<sup id="fnref:faq" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:faq" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="bens-reimagine-fellow-application-faq">Ben‚Äôs <em>Reimagine Fellow</em> Application FAQ</h2>

<h3 id="in-one-sentence-why-do-you-want-to-be-a-reimagine-fellow">In one sentence, why do you want to be a Reimagine Fellow?</h3>

<p>I want to see more art<sup id="fnref:art" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:art" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> happening in CECS; and I want to strengthen our
education and research ties to the Schools of Art &amp; Design, Music, and Digital
Humanities.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-that-have-to-do-with-the-reimagine-project">What does that have to do with the Reimagine Project?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The role of an artist is to ask questions, not to answer them</em> -<strong>Anton
Chekhov</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Elanor says in the video above, we don‚Äôt even know what tomorrow‚Äôs problems
are yet; so we need problem <em>finders</em>, not just problem <em>solvers</em>. Art and
artists have a key role to play in this (just ask Chekhov).</p>

<h3 id="why-are-you-the-best-person-to-do-this">Why are you the best person to do this?</h3>

<p>I‚Äôve made a career (so far) of deploying my technical/CS skills to artistic
ends: in my livecoding (both building
<a href="https://github.com/digego/extempore">tools</a> and <a href="/livecoding/index.html">doing live
gigs</a>), in starting the <a href="https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/lens/">ANU Laptop
Ensemble</a>,
in teaching our first-year art+code course
<a href="https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/">COMP1720</a>, etc.</p>

<p>Along the way I‚Äôve built strong networks in these areas across the ANU campus
and in the wider community, and I‚Äôve always said that I was keen to engage with
them more deeply‚Äîthis is my chance.</p>

<h3 id="so-youre-just-trying-to-score-a-grant-to-go-off-and-do-your-own-weird-art-thing">So you‚Äôre just trying to score a grant to go off and do your own weird art thing?</h3>

<p>Absolutely not. Being a Reimagine Fellow isn‚Äôt about doing something by
yourself‚Äîit‚Äôs way too big a project for that. It‚Äôs about weaving something
into the whole College<sup id="fnref:dna" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:dna" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, so that by 2050 it affects the way <em>everyone</em>
thinks.</p>

<h3 id="what-might-this-look-like-concretely">What might this look like, concretely?</h3>

<p>The Reimagine Project is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal">big, hairy, and
audacious</a>, so it‚Äôs
difficult to sketch out a detailed description or org chart. However, here are a
few ideas about what it might look like.</p>

<h4 id="in-the-short-term">In the short term‚Ä¶</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a CECS-supported ‚ÄúReimagine residency‚Äù (starting asap!) to support artists to
get involved and help us figure out what a Reimagined CECS looks like</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a new code/creativity/culture major (at both undergraduate and masters level)
where students take courses from within CECS, the <a href="http://soad.cass.anu.edu.au">ANU School of Art &amp;
Design</a>, and the <a href="https://music.anu.edu.au">ANU School of
Music</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>new courses within CECS on e.g. algorithmic music composition, creative
making, AI/Deep Learning Art, subversive computing/<a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2018/05/21/designed-for-evil/">designing for
evil</a><sup id="fnref:genevieve" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:genevieve" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>more PhD students doing practice-led research on interdisciplinary
art/CS/engineering projects</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>encouraging <strong>all</strong> CECS academics to engage with their peers and the wider
world by <em>making and exhibiting beautiful/interesting/challenging things</em>, not
just through journal papers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="in-the-mediumlong-term">In the medium/long term‚Ä¶</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a centre of excellence for digital arts/music/multimedia research, teaching
and creative practice (co-hosted by CECS and the <a href="http://cass.anu.edu.au">College of Arts &amp; Social
Sciences</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a thoroughly non-traditional project-based ‚Äúcreative tech‚Äù masters program,
with no classes, no heirarchies, just a bunch of brilliant students set loose
with duct tape, gaming GPUs, a giant bag of sensors &amp; actuators, soldering
irons, a 3D printer, oh my. (Geoff Hinchcliffe and I have discussed
this‚Äîwe‚Äôre both thrilled and terrified at the prospect. And I love what the
<a href="https://3ainstitute.cecs.anu.edu.au/#apply">3AI</a> master‚Äôs program is shaping
up to be, and am keen to be a part of it.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>incorporating into every course<sup id="fnref:every-course" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:every-course" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> the option to create and submit
a ‚Äúcreative work‚Äù to demonstrate attainment of the learning outcomes (ü§î
really Ben?)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I also look forward to having the time to think through what a deeply artistic
CECS looks like. I‚Äôm sure that in collaboration with the other Reimagine Fellows
and the rest of the design team we can come up even more ideas.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-this-further-the-broader-goals-of-the-reimagine-project">How does this further the broader goals of the Reimagine Project‚Ä¶</h3>

<h4 id="in-research">‚Ä¶in research?</h4>

<p>Artists have always been at the vanguard of building new things (or seeing/using
old things in new ways). If an artist has an idea in their head for what they
want to create, but the tools to realise it don‚Äôt exist yet, that artist is
<em>intrinsically</em> motivated to figure out how to make it happen.</p>

<p>I also want to be clear that my pitch here isn‚Äôt to view the arts as a technical
problem that needs to be <em>solved</em> by engineers and computer scientists: ‚Äúhey
artists, thanks for the last few thousand years, we‚Äôll take it from here‚Äù. We‚Äôve
already got too much technochauvinism in tech. Instead, the pitch is that a
newly-Reimagined CECS can <em>include</em> artists in shaping what the computer
scientists and engineers of 2050 look like, so that it‚Äôs <em>not</em> an ‚Äúus and them‚Äù.</p>

<p>Some of the top research institutions in the world are asking real questions in
the fields of creative technology, digital art, music and design: have a look at
<a href="#where-in-the-world-is-this-already-happening">the list below</a>.</p>

<h4 id="in-education">‚Ä¶in education?</h4>

<p>That Chekhov quote above really nails it. For some students, being asked to make
something creative/artistic is what it takes to flick the switch to go beyond
the ‚Äúwhat boxes do I need to tick for me to get a P/CR/D/HD‚Äù mindset to actually
asking the right questions. I see this sometimes in
<a href="https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/">COMP1720</a>, and it‚Äôs one of the most
enjoyable things about teaching that course.</p>

<p>More broadly, I want to see more dreamers, doodlers and ‚Äúcreatives‚Äù<sup id="fnref:creatives" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:creatives" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>
study engineering or CS at uni. Too often they feel like they have to choose
between ‚Äúpursuing the dream‚Äù or selling out and studying something boring &amp;
pragmatic, and I fear that we (CECS) miss out on some <em>brilliant</em> students
because of this. I want these students to know that they can pursue their
creative dreams, and in doing so they‚Äôll be doing top-class
engineering/CS/design work.</p>

<h4 id="in-outreach">‚Ä¶in outreach?</h4>

<p>Because of my <a href="/livecoding/index.html">livecoding</a> I get
asked to do outreach stuff all the time (you‚Äôre welcome, CECS marketing team
üòâ). I know why I get asked: DJing with code is so <em>different</em>, it‚Äôs a great
hook for engaging folks who might not have thought that combining code &amp; musical
creativity in that way was possible.</p>

<h4 id="in-culture">‚Ä¶in culture?</h4>

<p>The Reimagine Project isn‚Äôt just about doing the same things under a different
org-chart. It‚Äôs about changing the culture of Engineering &amp; Computing research
and practice. While the stereotypes about nerdy engineers and computer types
isn‚Äôt necessarily fair in my experience, there‚Äôs no smoke without a fire, and
there <em>are</em> some things we need to do better. Incorporating the arts and
creative expression deep within our education, research and outreach work will
change the way we communicate with the outside world, but it‚Äôll also change the
sorts of people we attract, and welcoming new perspectives into CECS is another
way we can enact cultural change.</p>

<h3 id="isnt-this-treading-on-the-toes-of-the-school-of-art--design-and-the-school-of-music-and-">Isn‚Äôt this treading on the toes of the School of Art &amp; Design (and the School of Music, and ‚Ä¶)?</h3>

<p>No‚Äîin fact we need to work with our colleagues in those places to make this
stuff happen. I already co-supervise PhD students with
<a href="https://twitter.com/mtchl">Mitchell</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/gravitron">Geoff</a>
from the School or Art &amp; Design, and <a href="https://twitter.com/tmtn">Terhi</a> from the
Centre for Digital Humanities Research, and I run the ANU Laptop Ensemble with
<a href="https://twitter.com/huntercomposer">Alec</a> from the School of Music. And I want
to see <em>more</em> of this type of cross-supervision across these parts of campus.</p>

<p>Actually, this ‚Äútreading on toes‚Äù question looms over the whole Reimagine
Project. I think the best way forward is to partner with the other parts of
campus to bring their expertise and smoosh it together with ours.</p>

<p>Concretely, that means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>sending CECS coursework students to take courses in other parts of campus (as
part of majors/minors/electives, etc.) as well as the other way around</li>
  <li>co-employing academics across Colleges in joint positions</li>
  <li>increasing our to participation in the ANU‚Äôs interdisciplinary HDR programs
like <a href="http://rsha.cass.anu.edu.au/students/future/iccr">ICCR</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="where-in-the-world-is-this-already-happening">Where in the world is this already happening?</h3>

<p>Here‚Äôs a few places, including what each place says about their goals (from the
marketing copy on their own website). Many (but not all) of these labs/groups
are in CS/Engineering Schools, or at least in design schools.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Stanford <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu">Center for Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics</a> (CCRMA) is a multi-disciplinary
facility where composers and researchers work together using computer-based
technology both as an artistic medium and as a research tool.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu">MIT Media Lab</a> is an interdisciplinary

</blockquote>

<h3 id="has-the-anu-ever-had-anything-like-this-before">Has the ANU ever had anything like this before?</h3>

<p>Sure, for example <a href="http://www.avatar.com.au/courses/acat/">this</a>, and it was
amazing. The story about why ACAT is no longer around is long, and I‚Äôve only
really ever heard it second/third-hand, and I‚Äôm not proposing to resurrect ACAT
as part of the Reimagine Project. But it‚Äôs important to know one‚Äôs history.</p>

<h3 id="sounds-like-a-huge-job-benhow-are-you-going-to-manage-it">Sounds like a huge job, Ben‚Äîhow are you going to manage it?</h3>

<p>Not on my own, that‚Äôs for sure. Only by building up our capacity in these areas.
As an example, <a href="https://twitter.com/cpmpercussion">Dr. Charles Martin</a> is just
about to start as a Lecturer in RSCS, and he‚Äôs a computer musician (apps and ML
for group musical improvisation). The campus also has many other
interdisciplinary artists who have been hiding their lights under bushels‚ÄîI
want to give them a banner to rally to.</p>

<p>We need to think big, and I look forward to a day where there‚Äôs a long list of
academic staff &amp; PhD students exploring new avenues for technologically and
culturally sophisticated artistic practice within CECS and the broader ANU
campus. That‚Äôs what I want us to be famous for.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-really-get-asked-these-questions-frequently-ben">Do you really get asked these questions <em>frequently</em>, Ben?</h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3 id="so-is-it-really-fair-to-call-it-an-faq">So is it really fair to call it an <em>F</em>AQ?</h3>

<p>Probably not. Sorry.</p>
