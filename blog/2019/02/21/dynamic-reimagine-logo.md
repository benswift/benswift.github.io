# A dynamic Reimagine logo




I keep harping on about the **Reimagine project** because I'm super pumped about
what it means for the way we do Engineering Computer Science here at the ANU
(see [here](/assets/pdf/reimagine-fellow-PD.pdf) and
[here](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/reimagine) for more info).

Reimagine branding is starting to go up around campus, so I decided to put
together an interactive version of the logo (because giant vinyl prints are
cool, but they don't spin on mouse-over).

It's made with [clojurescript](https://clojurescript.org) using
[Reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io), and as always on my blog you can
look at the
[source](https://github.com/benswift/benswift.github.io/blob/source/_cljs/reimagine_logo/src/reimagine_logo/core.cljs)
to see how it works.
