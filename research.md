**Come study with me**: if you're interested in doing Honours/Masters/PhD
research with me, [send me an email](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au). I always have
a few project ideas kicking around, but I'm also open to hearing about the
project/big idea that excites _you_. Send me

1. a **one-paragraph** description of the project you're interested in doing,
   and
2. a **link to something you've made**: a livecoding video, a project on GitHub,
   an academic paper---even a blog post

I get a lot of emails, so including these two things is a great way to show that
you've thought a bit about what sort of research project you're interested in
(and why I'd be a good fit as your supervisor). You should think hard about how
to make your email stand out from the crowd.
