The nature of livecoding is that it is performed (improvised) in-the-moment; the
gig (performance) _is_ the output (that's why it's called **live**coding), and
any artefact (e.g. a video recording) is useful documentation, but only a trace
of the work itself.

Still, documentation is an important part of one's artistic practice, so here's
a bunch of photos and videos from my gigs. Some of them are nice &
slick-looking, some of them are super-grungy videos shot on smartphones in the
crowd. Although I'm [working hard to track down any old
videos]({% link

lost to time. I like to assume that they were the best ones ðŸ˜‰
