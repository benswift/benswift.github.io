This is the source code for my blog - <https://benswift.me>. For more info on
how it's put together, see [this blog

## using hljs with xtlang

highlight.js [now has xtlang support](https://benswift.me) (woo-hoo!), but it's
provided as a language 'plugin' and isn't included in the standard ball of hljs
languages. This is just a heads up if you want to include the xtlang
highlighting on your own site---have a look in the `hljs-with-xtlang` branch to
see how it works.
