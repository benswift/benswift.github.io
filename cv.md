### Current courses

I am currently the course convenor & lecturer for the following courses in the
[ANU School of Computing](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/) (follow links
to the curriculum, available under a Creative Commons
[CC-BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) licence):

- [COMP2710: Laptop Ensemble](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2710-lens/) is a
  course open to students in computer science, music, art, and elsewhere at ANU
  (the course is co-taught with MUSI2205 in the _ANU School of Music_). In this
  course students learn fundamental skills of music computing, including digital
  synthesis, algorithmic composition, and musical interface design, putting
  these skills to use creating a computer musical instrument, composition, or
  interactive media work to present in concert at the end of the course.

- [COMP1720: Art & Interaction in New
  Media](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/) is a course about learning to
  tell stories through interactive code art. It's not _just_ an art course, and
  it's not _just_ a "coding" course: students engage with both of those domains
  at the same time, and (I hope) have a lot of fun in the process. No previous
  coding or artistic experience is required: COMP1720 teaches everything from
  the ground up.

- [EXTN1019: ANU Extension Creative
  Computing](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/creative-computing/)
  is a course where ACT Year 11 & 12 students learn the fundamentals of computer
  programming through the creative process of making music and visual art. As
  well as creating and performing their own new works of code-based art & music,
  this course contributes towards the students' ATAR _and_ they receive credit
  towards an undergraduate computing degree if they choose to study at ANU. As
  the School of Computing's first ever [ANU
  Extension](https://extension.anu.edu.au) course, this program attracts
  fantastic students who might otherwise not study engineering or computer
  science (either at ANU or elsewhere) and helps them _reimagine_ what it is to
  be a computer scientist or engineer in the 21st century.

### Past courses {#past-courses}

I have also written and delivered the following courses:

- [COMP2300: Computer Organisation and Program
  Execution](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/) is ANU's introductory
  computer architecture course, which I wrote and delivered from 2017--2018,
  and is now being delivered by [Uwe
  Zimmer](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/zimmer-ur). In this course
  students take a complex computer system ([the STM32L476G discovery "disco"
  board](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32l476gdiscovery.html)) home from
  week 1. That might seem daunting---and it's true that there's more stuff on
  such a board than one can master in one semester---but students can still
  learn a lot about CPUs (and how programs are organised and executed) by the
  end of the course.

- The [COMP2710 _Internet of Things (IoT)_ China Study
  Tour](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/china-study-tour/) is an in-country
  intensive study course conducted in partnership with the [Beijing Institute of
  Technology](http://english.bit.edu.cn/). In this course students learn about
  low-cost, network-connected embedded computing devices & their relationship to
  the broader computing landscape through building a prototype IoT artefact (and
  releasing the source code, parts list and build instructions on GitHub), while
  reflecting on the design, security, social and ethical challenges associated
  with the Internet of Things.
