I'm often invited to give talks & presentations. Because knowledge is
better when it's shared, I've made all my slides freely available
here---just click on any of the titles below. However, often my slides
don't make sense in isolation (if had everything I said written on my
slides and just read it out my talks would be **really boring**).

I am available as a guest speaker (and [livecoding]({% link
livecoding.md %}) performer) for both scholarly and corportate-y events. If
you're interested then [drop me a line](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au) and we can
discuss making it happen.
