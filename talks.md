I'm often invited to give talks & presentations. Because knowledge is better
when it's shared, I've made all my slides freely available here---just click on
any of the titles below. However, often my slides don't make sense in isolation
(if had everything I said written on my slides and just read it out my talks
would be **really boring**).

I am available as a guest speaker (and [livecoding]({{site.baseurl}}{% link
research.md %}) performer) for both scholarly and corportate-y events. If you're
interested then [drop me a line](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au) and we can discuss
making it happen.
