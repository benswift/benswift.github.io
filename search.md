This search box will take you to a [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)[^ddg]
page with the results of your search, but limited to the pages on
<https://benswift.me> (it does this by adding "site:benswift.me" to the end of
your query). If you want to come back to this page, you can use your browser's
back button.

Alternately, if you want to use Google search to do the same thing (the results
will be pretty much the same) you can use the same "site:benswift.me" trick [on
Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Abenswift.me).

[^ddg]:
    [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) is a web search engine, just like
    [Google](https://www.google.com/) or
    [AltaVista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaVista).
