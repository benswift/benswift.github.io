title: Tracking APS AI Transparency Statements
tags: ai government

Since 28 Feb 2025 all Australian Public Service (APS) agencies have been
[required to publish](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/engage-responsibly) a
"statement outlining their approach to AI adoption", which also "must be
reviewed and updated annually or sooner, should the agency make significant
changes to their approach to AI".

In the [spirit](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress) of
[similar](https://github.com/bundestag/gesetze)
[attempts](https://github.com/DCCouncil/dc-law) to
[track](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-education-state-policy-tracking)
[policy](https://github.com/openaustralia/theyvoteforyou) and
[law](https://github.com/openaustralia/openaustralia-parser)

[version](https://github.com/aclu-national/tracking-ll144-bias-audits)
[control](https://github.com/Cybersoft82/Privacy-Policy-Change-Detection-and-History-Tracking-Service)
tools, I've just released the
[APS AI Transparency Tracker](https://github.com/ANUcybernetics/aps-ai-transparency-tracker).

I'll leave it running (checking the statements once every 24h) and we'll get to
see how these statements evolve over time. Stay tuned!
