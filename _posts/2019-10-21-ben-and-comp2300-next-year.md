title: Ben and COMP2300 next year

Students[^organised-ones] are starting to turn their gaze towards 2020, and so
I've been getting a bunch of emails asking me if I'm teaching
[COMP2300/6300](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/) _Computer Organisation
& Program Execution_ again in Semester 1 2020.

The short answer : **no**. The slightly longer answer is that while I'll always
love COMP2300 (it's the first course I got to design & write myself) my energies
for the next couple of years are going to be poured into the [c/c/c
studio]({{site.baseurl}}{% link
_posts/2019-03-20-reimagine-fellow-project-pitch.md %}) (as part of my
[Reimagine Fellowship]({{site.baseurl}}{% link
_posts/2019-08-30-Im-a-reimagine-fellow.md %})). In 2020, [Charles
Martin](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/charles-martin/) will be
convening & running COMP2300---and he'll do a great job. I'll probably pop in
from time to time to give a guest lecture (and maybe even sing a revision song)
but he'll be the main convenor. So if you've got any questions about taking that
course in 2020 (either as a student, or perhaps as part of the tutoring team)
then you should reach out to [Charles](mailto:charles.martin@anu.edu.au).

[^organised-ones]: well, the organised ones, anyway
