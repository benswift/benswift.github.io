I'm now a [Reimagine Fellow]({% link
_posts/2019-08-30-Im-a-reimagine-fellow.md %}) and stuff to do with that program
(and getting the [c/c/c studio]({% link
_posts/2019-03-20-reimagine-fellow-project-pitch.md %}) up and running) is
starting to happen. As I've [done]({% link
_posts/2019-02-07-reimagining-engineering-cs-at-the-anu.md %}) [so
far]({% link _posts/2019-03-20-reimagine-fellow-project-pitch.md
%}) I'm planning to continue to work on this project "in the open", i.e. on this
blog. This means that if you've got ideas or want to help out, you can see where
I'm up to (and [get in touch](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au)), and it also
minimises the likelihood that I'll be forced to email around anything called
`project-plan-final-ACTUALLY-FINAL-v3.docx` ðŸ˜‰.

In preparation for a Reimagine Fellows workshop this week (Thursday September
12) I'm sketching out all the existing stuff that's happening on- (and off-)
campus relating to the c/c/c studio. This is all really rough, but it's a place
to collect the thoughts & names in my head.
