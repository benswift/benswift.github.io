## Workshop overview

### Intro

Is it possible to learn about algorithms through writing poetry about wealth
inequality? How about exploring the issue of social media use via sculptures
built using cybersecurity tools and concepts? Is it possible to design an
assessment task which encourages deep technical work and honest cultural
reflection, while still producing a genuinely interesting creative outcome?

This workshop brings together folks from all points of the
code/creativity/culture compass to design a _real_ assessment task for the
**c/c/c studio** creative computing outreach program. In fact, it _needs_ a
diverse range of voices to work properly. So if you've got thoughts and ideas
about CS/Engineering curriculum design, the arts, and life within the
socio-technical assemblage of our present age, then come along and have your
say!

This workshop is part of the
[CoDesign Culture Lab](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/events/event-series/codesign-culture-lab).
If you're coming to the culture lab and you'd like to be part of the workshop,

### Group formation {#group-formation}

#### Find your stickers

For this workshop it's important that each group has representatives from each
facet of the c/c/c triad. Look under your chair to find three stickers:

- the **red** <span style="color:#eb4d4b;">â¬¤</span> sticker is the _code_
  sticker---if you consider yourself a _code_ person

- the **blue** <span style="color:#3498db;">â¬¤</span> sticker is the _creativity_
  sticker---if you consider yourself a _creativity_ person

- the **yellow** <span style="color:#f1c40f;">â¬¤</span> sticker is the _culture_
  sticker---if you consider yourself a _culture_ person

- the **purple** <span style="color:#85522f;">â¬¤</span> sticker is for if you
  think that this whole "reducing one's identity in such a multifaceted problem
  space down to just a few stickers" thing is total bollocks---your job is to be
  your group's _enfant terrible_ ðŸ˜‰

{:.hl-para}

You can choose to have 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 stickers---it's up to you.

#### Find your team-mates

Once you've attached your stickers prominently to your forehead (or wherever you
decided to wear them) then you need to find three team-mates so that each group
has four members.

The one requirement is that each group must have _all_ of the stickers between
them. So, as you mill about finding team-mates, ask one another

1. why you chose to identify with the particular stickers you chose
2. which sticker was the hardest to decide on, and why

Once you've found a team, assemble at one of the tables and await further
instructions.

## Session 1: writing an assessment spec {#group-work-session-1}

In his intro, we introduced the c/c/c studio idea and set the scene for the
whole "code/creativity/culture" thing (spoiler: they're all _highly_ entangled).
You're now a curriculum designer for the c/c/c studio! Welcome aboard.

### Design brief

> Genius learns from nature, its own nature. Talent learns from art. Also,
> creativity and culture seem to be important. _Olivia Wilde_[^wilde]

[^wilde]:
    obviously, this is fake, although
    [Oscar Wilde said something similar](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/776726),
    and I'm _pretty sure_ he was
    [Olivia Wilde's](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1312575/) uncle

{:.hl-para}

_Your design brief for today_: in your group, create an assessment[^assessment]
task which teaches a particular **code** concept/tool by exploring a
problem/challenge facing our[^culture] **culture** through a particular
**creative** process/medium.

The educational context for this assessment task is the c/c/c studio---a
selective program for year 11 & 12 students. If you're more familiar with a uni
context, they're probably not too dissimilar from first-year undergraduates.

[^assessment]:
    you can think of it as an assignment, but that word has some baggage, so
    just think of it as a description of a thing which a student must submit
    which will be evaluated on whether it's a good thing

[^culture]:
    Part of the challenge here is that we don't live in a monoculture, at a
    local level (because filter bubbles), at a national level (because
    multiculturalism) and at a global level (because global village). Still, I'm
    using this word so the c/c/c schtick makes sense.

In this group session your group needs to produce a (draft) document. I don't
want to be _too_ dogmatic about the form and content---the whole point of this
workshop is to throw out the rulebook---but here's a example of the sorts of
things that are usually important in an assessment item:

- **description**: a high-level description of what the task is and what the
  students are required to deliver

- **background/motivation**: a bit more background on the task, tools, problem
  domain, as well as any pre-requisite skills the students will need

- **learning outcomes**: a list of learning outcomes for the assessment task (or
  which the task is designed to assess)

- **spec**: a concise, specific description of what the students are required to
  produce, including any specific constraints or requirements on either the
  deliverable or the process

- **resources**: a list of resources the students might find helpful in
  completing the task

- **faq**: a list of (anticipated) questions the students might have about the
  assessment task

At the end of this session you get to present your assessment task to the wider
workshop. So, your group will need to organise:

- a scribe (either on-paper or on a laptop) to write the document
- a presenter (or a creative group presentation strategy) for telling everyone
  about your amazing assessment task

If you want to work on paper there are paper templates floating around (let us
know if you'd like one). If you've got a digital scribe, then there are
electronic templates ([markdown]({% link
assets/documents/ccc-curriculum-design-workshop/ccc-assessment-task.md %}) and [MS
Word]({% link
assets/documents/ccc-curriculum-design-workshop/ccc-assessment-task.docx %})).

{:.hl-para}

One more thing to keep in mind: in the
[next group work session](#group-work-session-2) you'll be writing a set of
assessment criteria which will be used to assess the submissions for your
assessment task. So you don't have to worry about writing them down formally
just yet, but keep that in mind as you design your assessment task.

### Let's spin the wheels! {#spin-the-wheels}

You don't get to pick the code concept/cultural problem/creative process triad
which forms the basis for your assessment task. Instead, we'll spin the
code/creativity/culture wheels[^winwheel] and let fate[^fate] decide.

[^winwheel]:
    wheels powered by [Winwheel.js](https://dougtesting.net/home) by Douglas
    McKechie

[^fate]: well, the PRNG in your web browser, anyway

<script src="{% link assets/js/TweenMax.min.js %}"></script>

<style>
.wheelIndicator {

  margin-bottom:-0.2em;
}

.wheelResult {

  margin-bottom:1em;
}
</style>

#### the code wheel

This wheel selects the _tool/concept_ which the students need to leverage (and
in doing so, understand) in their submission. This is deliberately broad---you
can (and should) narrow it down in _your_ assessment task. Don't get hung up on
the "code" moniker, think about it as a computing/computer science tool/concept
more broadly.

Note: one other way to frame this is this is the skill/concept that you want the
students to learn (perhaps surreptitiously) in _doing_ the assessment task.

let codeWheel = makeWheel(
    benCodeConcepts, 
    "codeWheel-canvas",
    null,
    (wheel, indicatedSegment) => {
      targetSpans = document.getElementsByClassName(`${wheel.canvasId}-result`);
      for (let e of targetSpans) {
        e.textContent = indicatedSegment.text;
      }
    }
);});
</script>

#### the creativity wheel

This wheel selects the creative medium through which the student will explore
the problem.

<div class="wheelIndicator">â§¨</div>

<strong><span class="creativityWheel-canvas-result"></span></strong>

    "dance",
    "photography",
	"painting",
	"drawing",
	"textiles",
	"film",

      for (let e of targetSpans) {
        e.textContent = indicatedSegment.text;
      }
    }
);});
</script>

#### the culture wheel

This wheel selects the _problem/challenge_ facing our culture/society to explore
(and perhaps comment on) through the work. Again, you might want to narrow it
down to a particular angle on this problem, although it's worth thinking about
how to leave students to wrestle with what _they_ think about the problem, not
just picking a theme which implies that there's only one "right approach".

<div class="wheelIndicator">â§¨</div>

### Things to consider as you design your assessment task

Now that you've spun the wheels, you might be thinking that they've still left
you with a pretty broad scope---and you'd be right. Your group's job is to
narrow this down into a specific task which is tractable for your intended
audience of students. It's fine (good, even!) if you narrow it down a lot.

Some of your group members might have lots of experience designing assessment
tasks, others may have never done it before (although I'm sure that everyone's
_done_ one).

- for the _code_ and _culture_ wheel results in particular, what are the key
  aspects or sub-problems that you want the students to engage with? what are
  some of the creative ways you can imagine to get those concepts across?

- the Learning Outcomes are really important, and can act as a guide for the
  rest of the design task---don't leave them till the last minute

- what are the conventions of "assesment tasks"? how can you flaunt them?

- how can you ensure that the students engage seriously with the _code_ part of
  the problem? how can you make sure they actually build something, not just
  talk about stuff?

- in plain language, what do you want a student to learn through the process of
  completing your assessment task? (that will help with coming up with some
  learning outcomes)

- how might the _concept/tool_ and the _creative medium_ shape the responses to
  the problem? can you use this to your advantage in encouraging students to
  attain the learning outcomes?

- will the outcome (what the students produce) be something completely new, or
  will it be a reimagination/repurposing of an existing technology, or
  speculating on the impact of an existing technology as it develops into the
  future?

- how are you going to constrain the scope of your task so that it supports
  students from a wide range of backgrounds/abilities?

- do _you_ have any favourite resources or templates for designing an assessment
  task? a quick google turns up a few (e.g. this
  [blog post from the Australian Computing Academy](https://blog.aca.edu.au/assessing-the-digital-technologies-curriculum-5f81a98ce053)
  or this
  [more general assessment design framework from UTS](https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/learning-and-teaching/assessment-futures/designing-and-redesigning))
  but I'm sure you can find others as well

- what's the worst-case scenario you'd expect if you set your assessment task
  for a bunch of eager c/c/c studio students? how can you write the spec to
  minimise the chance of things going down this way?

- it's ok to use images, diagrams, YouTube clips, interactive widgets---the
  assessment task itself won't be printed on paper, it'll be hosted on the web

## Session 2: articulating the assessment criteria {#group-work-session-2}

As much as it feels gross and reductionistic to boil a student's mark down to a
number, we need to mark the submissions. Your group's second (and final)
deliverable is a set of assessment criteria for the assessment task.

Again, you need to create a document which could be handed to a marker so that
they could assess the submissions and give a mark & grade. Again, the exact
format of this document is up to you. There are a few ways to do this:

- a series of examples of what constitutes bad/good/excellent work---what would
  an _outstanding_ submission look like? what would a borderline-acceptable
  (e.g. a bare pass) submission look like?

- a set of criteria for each of the code/creativity/culture dimensions of the
  work, with descriptions of what bad/good/excellent work might look like

- a full rubric (2x2 grid) with criteria along the rows, grades (e.g. fail,
  pass, credit, distinction, high distinction) down the columns and a
  description in each grid square

### Things to consider as you design your assessment criteria

- the problems (from the culture wheel) are _not solvable through a single
  assessment task_, so don't make that the criteria---instead, you want students
  to explore & understand the problem, process & tool more deeply

- how do your criteria support students who haven't necessarily thought deeply
  about the "big questions" to do so? how do they encourage students who have
  thought about this stuff to go deeper?

## Takeaway questions

- Did the [wheels](#spin-the-wheels) (and the segments therein) provide enough
  structure for your assessment design exercise? Too much structure? If you were
  using them as a tool for assessment design in the future, how would you modify
  them?

- After participating, are you more or less convinced of the utility of the
  creative arts in teaching the code concepts? Why?

- What type of student would benefit the most from doing your assessment task?
  How are they similar/different from the students we see in our CS programs
  here in CECS?

- If **you** were in charge of this workshop and had to deliver it again, what
  would you change?

Thanks so much for participating ðŸ˜Š If your group wrote the assessment item on
paper, can you hand it to Ben (or one of the other facilitators) before you
leave ? If you did it electronically (e.g. using the [markdown template]({% link
assets/documents/ccc-curriculum-design-workshop/ccc-assessment-task.md %})) then
can you [email it to Ben](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au)?

## Appendices

### Presenter bio

Dr Ben Swift is a Senior Lecturer in the ANU Research School of Computer Science
(RSCS). As the leader of the code/creativity/culture (c/c/c) research group,
Ben's goal is to create spaces for talking about the way that code (software),
creativity (especially the arts) and culture (life) intersect in the modern
world. Ben's research contributions range from traditional Computer Science
(digital multimedia, web technologies and human-computer interaction) through to
invited livecoding (live code-based music performance) performances and
multimedia artwork installations.

In 2019 Ben was awarded one of the inaugural _Reimagine Fellowships_ to develop
the **c/c/c studio**, an ANU Extension outreach program which will teach
computer science to pre-tertiary students through making art, music and other
cool things with computers. The c/c/c studio will also provide a supportive
community in which a new generation of people can learn, create, and
share---unlocking the latent potential in students who never knew their diverse
interests (especially in the arts & music) could be used in engineering and
computing.
