title: Livecoding set ICLC'24 - Shanghai Concert Hall
---

I'm currently in Shanghai tomorrow night I'll be performing at the [Shanghai Concert Hall](https://www.shanghaiconcerthall.org/) as part of [ICLC '24](https://iclc.toplap.org/2024/program.html#table-day2). I'm told tickets are already sold out, but if you've already got one and you're coming along then come say hi after the set.

I'll try and put up a video of the performance (I'll be doing music, with LXT
and Beverly Edwards on visuals) once it's all done.
