Here in the [School of Cybernetics](https://3ainstitute.org) we are building our
capability in cybernetics&mdash;its histories and possibilities&mdash;and
working out how each of us will contribute to the new cybernetics for the 21st
Century.

This blog post, written for a general audience, is part of a content development
sprint, written in reponse to the task of developing a short (1000 words)
persuasive argument about the role and value of cybernetics as an approach to
shape futures through and with technology.

If you follow this blog, you'll know that I'm a [livecoder]({% link
livecoding.md %}). I _code_ (i.e. write computer programs) to make music in a
club setting, with an audience that just wants to dance and have a good
time[^niche]. Between the code, the thumping music, the dancing humans, and all
the other glorious complexities of live entertainment, there's certainly a lot
of different stuff going on. You might find watching a livecoder in action to be
entertaining, or impressive, or bewildering, or all of the above. Most of all,
when you see/attend a livecoding gig for the first time, I bet that your initial
feeling is one of _what is going on?_

In this post I'm going to use some ideas from cybernetics to try and help you
make sense of a livecoder performing in a club, in part to help you understand
for what it _feels like_ I'm doing when I do it. From there I want to think
about ways to make livecoding even better, that is, to figure out put on a
better show for the adoring crowds.

[^niche]:
    It's a pretty niche activity, but there's an [international
    community](https://toplap.org) of us, and if you're interested then you can

    gigs.

## Livecoder-in-the-club as a system

[Cybernetics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx79HLLboT8) is all about the
looking at and reasoning about **systems** with _goals_, interacting with and
connected to their _environment_ via perception/action _feedback loops_. These
sorts of systems exist at all sorts of different scales (big/small, fast/slow,
old/new, cheap/expensive, etc.) and they're [fractal in
nature](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10698938-the-fractal-organization)---it
doesn't matter what level of "magnification" you look at, each component of a
system is itself a system of interacting components, and each system is itself a
component interacting in a larger system. But since that's all pretty abstract,
let's return to the example of the livecoder-in-the-club. This is written in the
first person, but other livecoders may have similar understandings of their own
livecoder-in-the-club practice.

- I start with a full tank of **brain juice** which allows me to work on tricky
  coding problems. But it's mentally taxing. When I'm happy, rested & in the
  zone, I feel like I've got a full tank, but writing code takes mental energy,
  and so writing the code in the performance drains my brain juice until I'm
  cooked, and then I can't write any more code (or at least will write bad/buggy
  code) until I recharge.

- To write the **code** I tap my fingers on the keys of my keyboard. I use a
  [specialised program](https://emacs.sexy) for this (i.e. I don't write it in
  MS Word) which has a bunch of features to help, like different colours for the
  different parts of the code (e.g. functions vs variable vs numerical parameter
  values), and auto-completion, and inline documentation/help about the
  particular bit of code that I'm working on. This code is also projected onto a
  big screen in the club so that the dancers can look at it (or not).

- As the code runs, it generates **music**. Different parts of the code are
  responsible for different parts of the music, and I try and give the functions
  & variables in my code human-readable names (like `piano`) so that the
  correspondence between the code and the music is clear-ish. The music will
  only be generated if the code is running nicely (i.e. without bugs/errors) and
  is hooked up to the PA system in the club. If I crash the program (or if
  someone unplugs the PA) then the music will stop.

- The people in the club---people dancing, people chilling at the bar, people
  watching the code on the screen---are collectively having an experience which
  (hopefully) is giving them **good vibes**. Obviously this is a _huge_
  oversimplification, and the extent to which any individual is enjoying
  themselves (and therefore contributing positively to the amount of good vibes
  in the room) depends on all sorts of things. But, in a real sense, the
  creation of **good vibes** in the room is the goal of the live coder---or at
  least it's _my_ goal when I perform in this situtation. So I (like any
  performer) feed off the good vibes, replenishing (to some extent) my brain
  juice.

It's a bit clearer to see in a picture:

TODO

So, clearly,

> a livecoder is a machine for turning **brain juice** into **good vibes** (via
> **code** and **music**)

which is a nice way to think about it, and actually is a relatively accurate
picture of what I _feel_ is going on when I'm performing.

## How does cybernetics help us understand and improve this system?

In this account of livecoding-in-the-club, there are a few things worth
noticing:

- there are different "stocks" (reservoirs of brain juice, code, music and good vibes)

- there are various flows between those stocks, and in both directions (e.g. I
  turn brain juice into code by typing at my keyboard, but I also receive
  information about what the code looks like from my laptop screen, via my eyes)

- there's a goal: to put on a good show for the audience to enjoy (to increase
  the stock of good vibes in the room)

- the system includes closed loops, and so is capable of feedback

A key principle of cybernetics is that the structure of the system---what the
parts are, and how they relate to one another---determines the behaviour of the
system. But anyone can sketch out a (highly contestable) jumble of blobs and
arrows to describe whatever thing they're interested in. What do we gain from
seeing things in this way?

This is where another key idea---and person---in cybernetics/systems thinking
comes in: Donella Meadows'[^is-meadows-cybernetics] [Leverage Points: Places to
Intervene in a
System](https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/).
The key idea is this: once you've mapped out your system, you need to know where
the most effective "intervention points" to try and implement change? If you're
going to expend energy to make things better, where should you focus that energy
to get the most _leverage_?

In the livecoder-in-the-club system, to make changes to the system in service of
the the goal (as stated above) of creating maximum good vibes. One obvious
solution is to start the gig with a bigger reservoir of brain juice (either by
having a good night's sleep, popping an adderall, or whatever). Or it could be
to start with a larger code reservoir by starting with a bunch of code
pre-written[^blank-slate-code].

However, Meadows' rules for leverage also suggest that some interventions
provide more leverage than others[^different-interventions]. For example,
changing the flow rates (leverage point #10) is likely to have more impact than
just changing the sizes of the stocks/buffers (leverage point #11). This implies
that changing the rate at which I turn brain juice into code (perhaps having a
nicer keyboard, perhaps having better code auto-completion support, or perhaps
just good-ol' _practice_ to improve my coding skills) is likely to be more
impactful than starting with a bigger store of brain juice (so, thankfully,
there's no need to buy shady adderall on the dark web). Will Larson (who has
been a software engineering leader at Calm, Stripe, Uber, and Digg) [has some
interesting ideas on systems thinking as applied to software
development](https://lethain.com/systems-thinking/) that I'm keen to think more
about as well.

For even greater leverage, there are interventions which are related to
restructuring the system itself, for example adding new information flows
(leverage point #6). The dancers can already see the code, but what if I was
hooked up to a live [EEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography)
so they could see the current state of my brain juice?[^eeg]. And even higher up (in
terms of leverage) is changing the goals of the system itself (leverage point
#3). Why _do_ people come to a club to dance and have good vibes? What if their
goal was different?

[^eeg]:
    Coming up with a reliable, portable EEG machine which can measure a useful
    biometric signal which corresponds to an individual's perceived current
    level of brain juice is beyond the scope of this blog post.

Now, the thing about leverage is that it doesn't guarantee good or bad outcomes,
it just means you for a small amount of input you see a large effect in the
output. Figuring out where to intervene in the livecoder-in-the-club system is
one thing, figuring out how to intervene so that the changes are positive is a
deep challenge. Leverage means that when things go well they go really well, but
the opposite is also true (e.g. with margin calls in a bear market). I feel like
this is an especially apposite point for programmers, because the cheap leverage
afforded by software is catnip for programmers, but presents some real dangers.
(as [as Maciej Ceg≈Çowski puts so
eloquently](https://idlewords.com/talks/sase_panel.htm)).

[^is-meadows-cybernetics]:
    [Donella
    Meadows](https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/)
    tended to prefer terms like "systems thinking" and "systems change" rather
    than using the term "cybernetics" directly, but she certainly was involved
    with some of the key people & events in the cybernetics story, and her work
    is highly relevant to cybernetic ideas. Plus, [Google Books categorises her
    work under _Computers > Cybernetics_]
    (https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Thinking_in_Systems.html?id=leE8R9pehg4C&redir_esc=y),
    and you _know_ the Big G is never wrong about that stuff.

[^blank-slate-code]:
    This is actually a subtle point in livecoding. I (along with some other
    livecoders) am committed to starting each gig "from scratch" with a blank
    code page. However, I've written a lot of library code ahead of time to
    provide me with nice abstractions for making music with code, and I use that
    (hidden---not on the screen) from the very first line of code that I write.
    Thinking about the livecoder-in-the-club system one question that I'm
    pondering is whether that library code constitutes a larger stock of code,
    or whether it's a restructuring (an increase) of the flow rate from code
    into music, or both.

    To make things even more complicated, and there's _kindof_ a blurry line
    between where the code ends and the music begins in livecoding (i.e. there's
    the code you see on the screen, which is the code that I'm writing &
    executing "live", but there's also a bunch of pre-written code in my
    operating system's audio plumbing just to get the music to come out of the
    speakers properly).

[^different-interventions]:
    There's not enough room in this blog post for a full "systems change
    analysis" of the livecoder-in-the-club system according to all 12 leverage
    points, but if you're interested I do recommend you [check out that
    article](https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/)
    as a starting point.

## So what's the point?

Obviously the livecoder-in-the-club system described above is an
oversimplification; it makes certain things easy to see but renders other things
invisible, and every aspect of both the components (the things it talks about)
and their relationships (the connections between them) is contestable. But
that's one of the benefits by laying things out like this---we can at least see
the things that we're explicitly considering, and we may well need to add new
things to the model for consideration (and examine all the new connections and
potential feedback loops those new things create).

My main goal here is really just to provide a worked example of how ideas from
cybernetics and systems thinking can help us move beyond just describing things
to figuring out where to place our energies to effect change---where we'll get
the most leverage. Being the best livecoder I can be is a lifetime goal, just
like any other instrumental or artistic practice. I'm keen to keep using the
tools of cybernetics to push in that direction, and bring the assemblage of
dancing bodies of the livecoder-in-the-club system with me for the ride :)
