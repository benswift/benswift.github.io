As members of the new School of Cybernetics, every day we are all building our
capability in cybernetics – its histories and possibilities – and working out
how each of us will contribute to the new cybernetics for the 21st Century. All
of our people are spokespeople for our school and for the new cybernetics.
 
To support this mission, we have designed a professional development program
aimed at supporting us to effectively craft and communicate our own unique but
connected perspective on cybernetics to the world.
 
The program will be run in 3 phases: 

1. Content development – What do I have to say? 
2. Presentation and personal brand training – How should I say it? 
3. Media and 'presence' training – Why should people listen to me? 
 
Phase 1 will be a content development sprint. That's NOW!
 
What do I need to do? 
 
The task is to develop a short (1000 words) persuasive argument about the role
and value of cybernetics as an approach to shape futures through and with
technology.
 
You should draw on your existing knowledge, but also choose an element of
cybernetics to research in order to develop your thesis. This exercise will form
the basis for ongoing work with the ultimate goal of sharing these pieces with
the outside world (when we are ready!). You can select your desired audience,
and if in doubt, imagine a general audience (what would you write for your
friends who work in various places in government/industry/community
organisations/universities?).
 
For now, all you have to do is research and write the piece by Friday 19
November. We will then share with our colleagues for feedback (more on that
later!).
 
Feel free to discuss this task with your supervisor – we are very keen for
everyone to participate. It is not mandatory, but note that this first step is
essential if you are to take advantage of the presentation coaching in Phase 2.
