A big congratulations do my PhD student Chenchen for successfully completing his
PhD; his thesis title was _Weakly Supervised Vision and Language Representation
Learning in Sign Language Understanding_. It's freelly available online from the
[ANU Library](https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/items/174662f9-0aba-4ed2-a340-eea1574969b4).

Not only did he do excellent work, but (look at the date!) did a lot of it
alone, under lockdown. Really tough circumstances and a credit to you Chenchen
for coming out the other side.
