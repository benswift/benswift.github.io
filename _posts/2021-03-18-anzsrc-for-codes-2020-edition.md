The Australian Research Council (well, technically the [Australian Bureau
of](https://www.abs.gov.au) + their [NZ
counterparts](https://www.stats.govt.nz)) have updated the [_Field of Research_
codes](https://www.arc.gov.au/grants/grant-application/classification-codes-rfcd-seo-and-anzsic-codes)
which Aussie academics use to classify their work.[^interdisciplinary-complaint]

[^interdisciplinary-complaint]:
    I'm not the first interdisciplinary academic to complain about these types
    of classifications, and I'm sure I won't be the last, but that's not what
    this post is about.

I was trying to browse these new codes recently, and had a bummer of a time
trying to find the actual classification scheme (codes, hierarchy & code names).
The official page seems to be [this
one](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1297.0Main+Features12020?OpenDocument),
but the data is only available on sheet 3 of an excel spreadsheet, which is just
a bummer when all you want to do is <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> your way around
an HTML table in your web browser.

So, I've copied the relevant part of the spreadsheet into a regular-ol' webpage
here for your browsing pleasure.[^hosting]

    hopefully this is ok---the real data is Â© ABS and you should always go there
    for the canonical version
