title: DIYChatGPT Short Course for ANU Undergraduates
---

If you're an ANU undergraduate student you can enrol in an upcoming (next week!)
[upcoming 3hr course](https://mccuskerinstitute.anu.edu.au/study/knots/diy-chatgpt-llms-as-information-processing-machines/)
I've created called _DIY ChatGPT: LLMs as Information Processing Machines_. It's
running for the first time **next Thursday 17 July 10am--1pm** (although it will
run again later in the semester).

Here's the blurb:

> In this hands-on workshop you will train and use your own language model from
> scratch - with just pen and paper and a bit of dice rolling. Through
> interactive exercises and guided discussions, you’ll see how language models
> (even large language models like ChatGPT) are fundamentally information
> processing machines, turning language inputs into language outputs. The
> workshop builds from basic principles to more complex applications through an
> exploration of language modeling as a probabilistic process of predicting
> “what token comes next” in a sequence, and ends with a poetry slam (for real).

This course is a
["Know the Nature Of Things" KNoT](https://mccuskerinstitute.anu.edu.au/study/knots_explained/)
offered as part of the ANU's
[McCusker Institute](https://mccuskerinstitute.anu.edu.au/). They're for-credit
courses run by different folks all across campus, and a great way to explore
some of the cool stuff going on at ANU.
