If you're in Canberra this Thursday Jan 30 then you should come to a (free) gig
that the c/c/c studio is putting on in the [Peter
Karmel](https://www.anu.edu.au/maps#show=29113) Big Band room (at the ANU School
of Music).

Get away from the [fires &
smoke](https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6600587/namadgi-fire-now-at-2575ha-total-fire-ban-declared/)[^fires]
and come see an evening of experimental sounds in processed voice, livecoding,
and neural networks with musicians from the ANU code/creativity/culture studio
and special guest [Fiona Sullivan](https://www.fisounds.com) (USA).

- **time**: 5:45pm--7pm
- **location** Big Band Room, [Peter Karmel
  Building](https://www.anu.edu.au/maps#show=29113), ANU School of Music
- **cost**: free

Here's the setlist:

| time     | artist                                               |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 6:00pm   | Charles (neurofeedback musical AI)                   |
| 6:10pm   | FBK (livecoded music/visuals, live vocal processing) |
| 6:25pm   | Alec                                                 |
| 6:35pm   | Chloë, Alec, Charles                                 |
| 6:50pm   | Fiona Sullivan (USA)                                 |
| _7:05pm_ | _finish_                                             |

There's also a [FB event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/541225126490467/)
as well if you're into that sort of thing.

[^fires]:
    I know that you can't get away from them; and the loss of flora & fauna is
    heartbreaking, not to mention the human cost.

Kieran will be livecoding visuals in GLSL, Charles will be (very musically!)
fighting with his AI, I'll be dropping beats in Extempore and Fi will be
_amazing_. See you there.

Note: if you've never been there before, the [Peter Karmel
building](https://www.anu.edu.au/maps#show=29113) is the one next to the "main"
ANU School of Music building. The Big Band room is off the foyer/atrium, right
near the main entrance.
