I'm launching the **Cybernetic Studio** next week at SXSW Sydney. If you're
attending, come to Chippendale on Wednesday afternoon (4--6pm, search for
_Cybernetic Studio Launch_ in the SXSW app) and see what we've been building.

The Cybernetic Studio is a lab-style initiative exploring responsible innovation
through creative, embodied approaches to technology. Which is a fancy way of
saying: we build things to think with[^making-to-think], and we try to do it in
ways that don't just reproduce the surveillance capitalism playbook. Nam Jun
Paik used technology in order to hate it properly, the Studio aims to do that
for generative AI specifically.

[^making-to-think]:
    This is the core of research-through-practice---you can't think your way to
    understanding complex sociotechnical systems, you have to build them and
    watch how they fail.

The launch project is "Human Scale AI"---an attempt to slow computations down
and blow them up so we can actually see them at work. Two artefacts I'll be
showing:

**Perceptron Apparatus**: TODO

**My First LLM**: TODO[^demystification]

[^demystification]:
    There's a particular kind of technical literacy I'm after here. Not
    "everyone should learn to code", but rather "everyone should have access to
    mental models that aren't just anthropomorphic vibes about what AI wants or
    thinks."

Both pieces are about materiality and scale. Can you understand something
differently when you can touch it, when it operates at human perception speed,
when you can see all the moving parts at once? I suspect yes, but that's what
the studio is for---figuring out what actually works.

The event is hosted with Dr. Cath Ball, who always brings the juice. Should be
good conversations.

It's ticketed, but if you're a SXSW badge-holder you you can register via the
app. Come along, have a few drinks on us, see some interesting human-scale AI
artefacts, have some interesting conversations about where this is all heading.
