Interaction in New Media_ major project exhibition. This year's theme is
_listening **in**/listening **out**_.

Here are the details:

- **date**: Sat Nov 9
- **time**: 4:30pm--6:30pm
- **location**: HN computer labs 1.23 & 1.24 (ground floor of the [Hanna Neumann

The students have been working super hard (here's a [sneak
peek](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/showcase/)) so come along, play
with some cool interactive browser artworks and see some of the cool
code/creativity/culture work going on here at the ANU.
