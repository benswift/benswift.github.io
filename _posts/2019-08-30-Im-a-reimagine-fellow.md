If you've been following the CECS newsletter, you'll know that the inaugural
[Reimagine Fellows](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/reimagine/reimagine-fellows) have been
announced, and I'm one of them ðŸ™ŒðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³. It's very exciting, and it means the
[c/c/c studio]({% link
_posts/2019-03-20-reimagine-fellow-project-pitch.md %}) is going to be a real
thing in 2020 (and beyond). It's also a relief to be able to tell people, since
I've had to keep the good news under my hat for the last couple of months.

There are **lots** of details still to figure out, and I'm going to be
talking to lots of folks over the next little while about how best to make this
grand vision happen (if you'd like to chat, [get in
touch](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au)). But to give you a flavour, here's a snazzy
video the clever folks at CECS made:
