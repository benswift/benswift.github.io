For the last year or so my team has been collaborating with the good folks at
[BOHO Interactive](https://www.bestfestivalever.com.au) and the National Gallery
of Australia on something which launches tonight---the _NGA Un-Tour_.

From the [NGA website](https://nga.gov.au/events/un-tour-the-hidden-gallery/):

> Experience an immersive cybernetic walking tour of the National Gallery after
> dark. Travel through familiar and behind-the scenes spaces and investigate the
> dynamic relationships between humans, technology and the built environment
> found within works of art and the Gallery itself. Wear your walking shoes and
> join us as we explore previously hidden parts of the building and gardens.
>
> Held of over one week during the Gallery's 40th birthday celebrations. This
> special event is co-presented by the National Gallery and the ANU School of
> Cybernetics.

I'm not sure if there are any tickets left, but if there are you should
definitely check it out. You won't get another chance to experience one of
Canberra's cultural institutions in this way for a long time.
