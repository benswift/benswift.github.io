title: Parental leave, take 2
---

Our family has recently [grown by one
member](https://github.com/benswift/benswift.github.io/commit/eb7fd10ac87c1059047e6e25783db01847c73e17).
I'm proud and exhausted and happy; it's a really wild (and mostly very nice)
cocktail of feelings. If you [follow me on
twitter](https://twitter.com/benswift/status/1301318122356396038) you might have
already heard this exciting news.

Anyway, I'm taking advantage of the ANU's fantastic parental leave for the
second time, and so I'll be a full-time Dad for the rest of the year. My
approach to answering my emails and doing work stuff will be [pretty much the
same as last time]({% link
_posts/2019-02-26-on-parental-leave-and-auto-reply-messages.md %}), so I'm sorry
if you were relying on me for something work-related in the near future. I'll be
back in 2021 refreshed and ready to be part of the ANU CS team and the [c/c/c
studio](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/).
