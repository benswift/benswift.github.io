title: Blog refresh
---

Another year, and another blog refresh. It's still a clojure-powered static site
with my own fumbling, hand-rolled css, but this time I'm using
[Cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org/) which has been pretty nice to work with so
far.

Sorry that a bunch of links to old posts are broken at the moment---I'm in the
process of fixing that up. If you're really stuck trying to find something then
[send me an email](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au).

The other big change is that the Extempore documentation posts have all been
removed. A little while ago I did some work to set up the Extempore docs on a
[separate site](http://digego.github.io/extempore/), and that really is the best
place to go for that stuff now. I considered keeping my old blog posts around
for posterity, but a lot of it was out-of-date anyway, so I decided it was
safest to get rid of it completely and redirect people to the new documentation
site. As always, if you get stuck, let me know on the [Extempore mailing
list](mailto:extemporelang@googlegroups.com).
