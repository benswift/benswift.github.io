If you're coming to the upcoming [International Conference on Live
Coding](http://iclc.toplap.org/2020/) (ICLC '20) in Limerick,
Ireland, then it's not too late to sign up for my workshop **Introduction to
music-making in Extempore**. Even if you're not coming to the rest of the
conference, you can still sign up for the workshop.

This workshop will provide a hands-on introduction to making music in the live
coding programming environment [Extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore).
The workshop will cover:

- the fundamentals of making sound (starting from "hello sine")

- an overview of Extempore's audio signal chain (especially the built-in and
  highly configurable modular synth)

- introduction to note-level live coding with the Extempore pattern language

No Extempore or previous live coding experience necessary (although experienced
practitioners are welcome as well). Just bring a laptop with macOS, Windows or
Ubuntu installed and we'll start from scratch. All the required software is
freely-available, and a binary release of Extempore will be provided (for
Windows/macOS) so those users won't need to build Extempore from scratch

Registration is through
[Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/introduction-to-music-making-in-extempore-tickets-89794851819),
and if you've got any questions [send me an email](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au)
or [ping me on twitter](https://twitter.com/benswift).
