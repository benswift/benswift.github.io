title: "DeepSeek and Shallow Moats: Implications for Higher Education"

The higher education sector has form for betting on technological moats that
turned out to be mirages. In the early 2010s, we rushed to build MOOC platforms,
convinced we'd need our own infrastructure to survive in the digital age. A
decade later, most of those courses (and the custom platforms we built to host
them) are abandoned. As Large Language Models (LLMs) reshape education, we risk
repeating this costly mistake.

The recent release of [DeepSeek R1](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1),
an open-weight LLM that rivals proprietary alternatives, is a timely reminder
that the AI landscape remains highly dynamic. There are so many LLM releases
these days it's hard to cut through the hype, but it does
[looks like the results are legit](https://venturebeat.com/ai/open-source-deepseek-r1-uses-pure-reinforcement-learning-to-match-openai-o1-at-95-less-cost/).
And because it's an open-weight model, other providers (or even
individuals---assuming they've got some beefy hardware) can run the models too,
as
[Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/deepseek-r1-is-now-available-on-azure-ai-foundry-and-github/)
and
[Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/deepseek-r1-models-now-available-on-aws/)
are already doing.

TODO maybe say one sentence about the specific benchmark improvement.

While DeepSeek's technical achievements are impressive, the deeper story lies in
what it tells us about the state of LLM development. The argument of the 2023
[leaked Google memo](https://semianalysis.com/2023/05/04/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither/)
asserting "we have no moat, and neither does OpenAI" seems to be holding up.
This poses a strategic question for higher education leaders: how should
institutions position themselves in relation to AI technology?

Some universities have already placed significant bets, signing exclusive
partnerships with major AI companies. The California State University system's
deal with OpenAI will
[provide ChatGPT access to 500,000 students and faculty](https://openai.com/index/openai-and-the-csu-system/).
UNSW Sydney has
[inked a similar agreement](https://www.unsw.edu.au/newsroom/news/2024/12/UNSW-Sydney-signs-landmark-agreement-with-OpenAI).
These moves reflect an understandable desire to get ahead of the curve, but they
may also lock institutions into particular technical ecosystems just as
alternatives are proliferating.

The emergence of models like DeepSeek R1 suggests a different path forward.
Rather than pursuing exclusive relationships with specific providers,
institutions might better serve their communities by staying provider-agnostic
(where they engage at all). This approach acknowledges both the rapid pace of
technical change and the likelihood that tomorrow's leading models may come from
unexpected sources.

TODO could add a spicy line about letting the VCs burn money while the LLM
providers chase the train---we don't want to be carrying the can. Maybe.

For individual educators, DeepSeek's release reinforces what many have already
realized: the specific model matters less than how we integrate AI capabilities
into our pedagogical practice. Whether students use GPT-4, Claude, or DeepSeek,
the fundamental challenges remain the same. How do we design assessments that
meaningfully evaluate learning in an AI-augmented world? How do we help students
develop the critical thinking skills to effectively collaborate with AI tools?

The resource implications of recent developments also deserve attention.
NVIDIA's recent stock market tumble - triggered partly by predictions that new
training techniques could reduce GPU requirements - highlights how quickly the
technical and economic foundations of AI can shift. For universities considering
major investments in compute infrastructure, this volatility suggests caution.

Perhaps most intriguingly, DeepSeek's emergence from China's AI ecosystem raises
questions about the future geography of AI development. As some nations
implement increasingly restrictive AI policies, others may step into leadership
roles in open-source AI research and development. This could have profound
implications for international research collaboration and data sovereignty.

For university administrators and planners, these developments suggest several
key principles:

1. Avoid long-term exclusive commitments to specific AI platforms or providers
2. Invest in developing institutional AI literacy and governance frameworks
3. Focus on building adaptable infrastructure that can accommodate multiple AI
   tools
4. Prioritize teaching students how to evaluate and work with AI systems, rather
   than mastering specific platforms

The democratization of AI capabilities also creates opportunities. As training
and deployment costs decrease, universities may find it increasingly feasible to
develop specialized models for specific academic domains or research
applications. However, such projects should focus on unique institutional needs
rather than attempting to compete with general-purpose commercial models.

Ultimately, DeepSeek R1 reinforces a crucial message: in the AI era, competitive
advantage will come not from controlling access to specific models, but from
skillfully integrating AI capabilities into our core educational mission.
Universities that build their strategies around particular AI platforms risk
finding themselves trapped in technological dead ends, while those that focus on
developing institutional AI literacy and adaptable frameworks will be better
positioned to embrace whatever technological developments emerge.

The real moat in higher education isn't technological - it never has been. It's
the ability to create transformative learning experiences and generate new
knowledge. As we navigate the AI revolution, we should remember that technology
is merely a tool in service of these fundamental goals. The winners won't be
those who bet early on the right AI platform, but those who most effectively
help their communities master the art of learning and creating in an
AI-augmented world.
