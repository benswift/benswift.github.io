## Extempore hacking

First, set Extempore up on your machine using the [quickstart
instructions](https://extemporelang.github.io/docs/overview/quickstart/).

Then, depending on which path you'd like to go down first, continue to either
the [sharedsystem (synthesis & sampling)
guide](https://extemporelang.github.io/docs/guides/sharedsystem/) or the
[pattern language
guide](https://extemporelang.github.io/docs/guides/pattern-language/).

## Demo time & open feedback

At the end of the workshop, there will be a chance to share with the group both
the things you've made today and any thoughts on how we can do things
(Extempore-wise) better, friendlier, open-er and more accessible. Improving the
onboarding experience for Extempore is one of my big goals this year, so all
attendees get a chance to contribute to that broader mission.
