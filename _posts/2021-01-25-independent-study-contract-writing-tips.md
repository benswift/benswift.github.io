title: Independent Study Contract writing tips

Many students here at the ANU School of Computing take a capstone project at the
end of their undergraduate degree. There are a few different variations (e.g.
half-year vs full-year, "research" vs "implementation", etc.), but overall these
projects are a chance for students to put together all the skills they've
learned in their degree program in a supervised project where _they're_ the
boss.

To take on one of these project, students need to find a supervisor, decide on a
project and sign an **independent study contract** (ISC). While these ISCs
_could_ be seen as a tick-and-flick waste of time, when done well they're an
important part of the project.

If you're a student writing an ISC (at the ANU School of Computing at least)
there two "meaty" parts to your ISC: the _project description_, and the
_learning outcomes_. Putting some hard work into those parts at the beginning of
your project is totally worth it. Your supervisor can (and should!) help you
out, but it's your project, and you should make sure it reflects the project you
want to do.

## Tips for writing a good ISC

All projects are different, and therefore so are all ISCs. The best tip I can
give is to _write an ISC that you'll **want** to keep looking at throughout the
project_. It's tempting to see the sole purpose of the ISC getting a permission
code to enrol in the project course. But it's something that should guide your
research, and something which you should be able to point to at the end and say
"yep, I achieved my goals".

### Project Description

- this is kindof a marketing exercise: you're trying to "sell" your project to
  an interested observer, so make it seem interesting---give it a "hook"

- length: one or two paragraphs (it should fit in the space on the form), and
  should be understandable by one of your classmates

- don't write it out by hand straight on to the form; this is the sort of thing
  you want to have a few drafts at (including getting feedback from your supervisor)

- don't _just_ say vague stuff like "explore various techniques for..." or
  "investigate different approaches to..."; if you're gonna do that you need to
  also have something about what you're trying to find with your
  explorations/investigations, and how you'll measure whether you',re successful

- if you're going to create something (e.g. a piece of software, a user study)
  then mention it in the project description

### Learning Outcomes

- how many? you probably want 3 (Â±1)

- the "standard" way to frame learning outcomes is to write them as
  continuations of the sentence: "at the end of this project, the student will
  be able to..."

- think about what you'd like to be able to do once you've completed the project
  and work backwards from there
