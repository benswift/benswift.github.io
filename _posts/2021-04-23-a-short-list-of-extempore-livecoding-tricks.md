Yesterday's [LENS](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2710-lens/) class
discussion turned into an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/) of how I do
certain things when I'm livecoding in Extempore. As promised, here's a blog post
where I've put together all of the things we've discussed (with a bit more
explanation). If you're in the LENS '21 class this'll hopefully be a helpful
complement to yesterday's class discussion. If you're not in the class, then
maybe you've always been curious about certain things I (over)use in my
livecoding sets? This is maybe a bit too niche to go in the general Extempore
documentation, but if you've got any questions then you can hit me up on Teams
(for LENS students) or the [Extempore mailing
list](mailto:extemporelang@googlegroups.com) (everyone else).

## the `cosr` macro

`cosr` is just a convenient way of sinusoidally modulating something with a
period synced to the tempo.

When it came to writing up this part of yesterday's discussion I had _déjà
vu_---I was sure I'd written this stuff up elsewhere. Turns out I have---it's in
the main Extempore docs as part of the
[pattern](https://extemporelang.github.io/docs/guides/pattern-language/#what-is-cosr)
guide.

One other tip which I mentioned yesterday: if you use fractions for the period
(final argument) which have a co-prime numerator & denominator (e.g. 7/3 or
15/8) then you'll get interesting accenting patterns, but which will still
repeat (so it gives a bit more structure than just using `random`).

One other related trick that I use is doing "mod" calculations on the `beat`
variable (which is an explicit argument in most temporal recursions), but is
also implicitly bound in the pattern expression if you're using the pattern language:

```extempore
(if (= (modulo beat 2) 0)
    (println 'downbeat))

(if (= (modulo beat 2) 1)
    (println 'upbeat))
```

## adding instruments to the sharedsystem setup

The default sharedsystem instruments are defined near the top of the
`examples/sharedsystem/audiosetup.xtm` file:

```extempore
(make-instrument syn1 analogue)
(make-instrument syn2 analogue)
(make-instrument syn3 analogue)
(make-instrument kit dlogue)
(make-instrument samp1 sampler)
```

If you want to use different instruments, you can add them to the various DSP
callbacks `dsp1` to `dsp5` (this multi-DSP-function setup is to allow the audio
engine's work to be distributed across multiple cores).

In each of the DSP functions (e.g. `dsp1`), the actual work of getting the
"signal" out of the relevant instrument happens in a line like this:

```extempore
(set! out (syn1 in time chan dat))
```

To add e.g. an `fmsynth` to the sharedsystem setup, there are two steps:

1. define the `fmsynth` instrument somewhere with `(make-instrument fmsynth fmsynth)`

2. call the `fmsynth` function in one of your DSP functions (doesn't matter
   which one---they all get summed in the end) callbacks and make sure the
   return value is added to one of the `out` variables
   
Here's an example (in `dsp1` as per the previous example):

```extempore
(set! out (+ (syn1 in time chan dat)
             (fmsynth in time chan dat)))
```

Then, any notes you play (using `play`) on the `fmsynth` instrument will make
their way into the audio output.

## markov chains

As discussed yesterday, Scheme (most lisps, really) makes it pretty easy to
represent markov chains.

Consider the following temporal recursion, which (in addition to the usual
`beat` and `dur` arguments) also takes a `pitch` argument. This is the exact
code I wrote yesterday:

```extempore
(define (obi-lead beat dur) pitch
  (play samp1 pitch (cosr 75 20 5/3) dur 2)
  (callback (*metro* (+ beat (* .5 dur))) 'obi-lead (+ beat dur) dur
            (random (cdr (assoc pitch '((60 60 63 67)
                                        (63 67 60)
                                        (67 58)
                                        (58 60)))))))

(obi-lead (*metro* 'get-beat 4) 1/4 60)
```

The markov chain happens in that `(random (cdr (assoc ...)))` line at the end of
the definition of the `obi-lead` function. A couple of things to note:

- the `cdr` is only necessary to make sure that a "self-transition" (i.e. the
  pitch staying the same) only happens if you explicitly add the same pitch as
  an element _other than_ the first element of the list. Otherwise, you wouldn't
  be able to make a markof chain that always went to a _different_ pitch from
  the current one.

- the `random` call isn't a special "markov" random, it's just the normal
  `random` picking from a list of pitches (so you can use the same "use the same
  element multiple times for weighted sampling" trick mentioned below)

- you can do whatever you want with the `pitch` argument inside the body of the
  `obi-lead` function---the fact that we `play` it here is a common pattern, but
  you could e.g. fire out an OSC message, etc.

- this is just a specific example of the more general class of algorithms which
  use a temporal recursion to pass variables to subsequent callbacks, and
  potentially do tests/operations on said variables to change them for future callbacks

- the onus is on the livecoder to make sure that each possible state (i.e. each
  value that `pitch` can take) is represented as the head (`cdr`) of one of the
  lists. But as long as you satisfy that invariant then the `obi-lead` markov
  process will just keep on playing the `pitch` as it travels through time and
  space[^mb].

## weighted random selections from a list

As promised (Caleb!) here's the syntax for doing a weighted random sample: the
key is that the argument to `random` isn't a list of `cons` pairs, it's multiple
`cons` pair arguments, each one of the form `(cons WEIGHTING VALUE)`.

```extempore
;; here's an example: note that it's in a "do 10 times" loop to show that the
;; values are indeed sampled using the appropriate weighting
(dotimes (i 10)
  (println 'i: i (random (cons 0.1 1) (cons 0.9 -1))))

;; printed output:
;; 
;; i: 0 -1
;; i: 1 -1
;; i: 2 -1
;; i: 3 -1
;; i: 4 1
;; i: 5 1
;; i: 6 -1
;; i: 7 -1
;; i: 8 -1
;; i: 9 -1
```

Note that if you're happy with just rough "this value is twice/three times as
likely as the others" then it's usually simpler to just randomly sample
(equally-weighted) from a list, including duplicate values for the things you
want to turn up more often in the output:

```extempore
;; 0 will be twice as likely as 3 or 7
(random (list 0 0 3 7))
```

## `rel` for relative pitches

<div class="hl-para" markdown="1">

From here on, all the following code snippets assume you've loaded the pattern
language with 

```extempore
(sys:load "libs/core/pattern-language.xtm")
```

Note that the pattern language library is loaded when you load the sharedsystem
as well.

</div>

Based on the (global) `*scale*` variable, you can use `rel` to calculate pitches
"relative to" a starting pitch.

So, if you're starting with a middle C (midi note `60`) and you want to go `2`
notes up the scale (and you haven't changed value of the `*scale*` variable from
the default "C natural minor" scale) then you can use:

```extempore
(rel 60 2)
```

This can be handy when paired with the `range` function (which just generates
lists of integers) for running your scales:

```extempore
(:> scale-runner 4 0 (play samp1 (rel 60 @1) 80 dur) (range 8))
```

Note that this is just a slightly terser version of `pc:relative` (in
`libs/core/pc_ivl.xtm`) function, which doesn't use the `*scale*` variable by
default. Note _further_ that `rel` takes an optional third argument for
providing a different scale, if e.g. you want to use a different scale for your
"relative pitch" calculation than you're currently using elsewhere in the piece.

Here's an example:

```extempore
;; set scale to F natural minor
(set! *scale* (pc:scale 5 'aeolian))

;; use a Fm7 chord (a subset of F natural minor) for the relative pitch calculation
(rel 65 (random 4) (pc:chord 5 '-7))
```

If you `println` the output of that `(pc:chord 5 '-7)` (_Fm7_) function, you'll
get the result `(5 8 0 3)`, which corresponds to the following pitch classes:

- `5`: F
- `8`: A♭
- `0`: C
- `3`: E♭

which are the pitches from an Fm7 chord, so it all checks out.

As one final tip, you can just skip the call to `pc:chord` altogether and do
something like:

```extempore
(rel 65 (random 4) '(5 8 0 3))
```

This makes it super-easy to make quick edits, e.g. if you want to flatten the
fifth (C). But it does make it a little less readable for the audience (and
let's face it, reading `(pc:chord 5 '-7)` was already pretty tough going for
most folks outside the _music theory_ ∩ _computer programmer_ intersection).

## `nof` and the macros vs functions distinction

`nof` (think "give me _n_ of these") is a Scheme macro for creating a list by
repeatedly evaluating a form. 

So, one way to get a list of 10 `0`s is:

```extempore
(nof 10 0)
```

To get a list of 4 random integers between `0` and `9` (inclusive) you could use:

```extempore
(nof 4 (random 10))
```

I just evaluated the above form on my machine; the result was `(0 9 9 8)`. Note
that the numbers are different; so the `nof` macro is obviously not just taking
the result of a single call to `(random 10)` and repeating it `4` times to
create a list.

This is where the fact that it's a _macro_---not a function---comes into play.
One trick for looking at what a macro form "macroexpands" out to is calling
`macro-expand` (note that the `nof` form has been quoted using `'`):

```extempore
(println (macro-expand '(nof 4 (random 10))))

;; prints:

;; (make-list-with-proc 4 (lambda (idx) (random 10)))
```

So, the list is actually formed by four repeated calls to a `lambda` (anonymous)
function, and that's why the four random numbers in the above list are different.

If this isn't actually the behaviour you want---if you want the same random
number repeated four times, there's a `repeat` function which you probably want
to use instead. Notice the difference:

```extempore
(println (nof 4 (random 10)))
(println (repeat 4 (random 10)))

;; prints:

;; nof: (1 3 3 6)
;; repeat: (5 5 5 5)
```

So keep that in mind when you're using `nof` in your pattern language. It'll
probably just work, but this subtle macro vs functino thing may be the cause of
errors or weird behaviour that you see.

## quasiquote (<code>`</code>) vs regular quote (`'`)

The quasiquote (<code>`</code>) symbol (which is also called the _tilde_) is like the
normal quote operator (`'`), except that you can "undo" the quoting (i.e. eval)
inner forms as necessary using the unquote operator (`,`).

That's not easy to get your head around when explained in words, but here's an
example:

```extempore
;; this is kindof tedious to write
'(c3 | | | | | d3 e3)

;; so instead we write
`(c3 ,@(nof 5 '|) d3 e3)

;; don't forget the @ (splicing) part; this is probably not what you want...
`(c3 ,(nof 5 '|) d3 e3)

;; result: (c3 (| | | | |) d3 e3)
```

## modulating filter (or other) params over time

One way to do it is show in the example file
`examples/sharedsystem/analogue_synth_basics.xtm`. Have a look around line 39,
where it says:

```extempore
;; and now add a second pattern to 'sweep' the filter
(:> B 4 0 (set_filter_env syn1 40.0 100.0 (trir 0.0 1.0 1/32) 100.0) (nof 16 0))
```

## playing a loop which then stops

The pattern language isn't really designed for playing one (or two, or three, or
_n_ for _n < ∞_) shot loops. It's really designed for things which will keep on
looping until you stop the pattern.

If you want to play a sequence of events which runs for a while and then stops,
then using a standard temporal recursion is probably best.

Here are a couple of examples. First, this recursion will keep playing the notes
until the `pitch` argument gets to `72`.

```extempore
(define (ascending-chromatic beat dur pitch)
  (play syn1 pitch 80 dur)
  (if (< pitch 72)
      ;; note the `callback` is inside the `if`
      (callback (*metro* (+ beat (* .5 dur))) 'ascending-chromatic (+ beat dur) dur
                ;; pitch gets incremented by 1 in each subsequent callback
                (+ pitch 1))))

;; kick it off - note that we're passing the initial pitch argument
(ascending-chromatic (*metro* 'get-beat 4) 1/4 60)
```

Now, both the "increment" part `(+ pitch 1)` and the "stopping criteria" part
(i.e. the `(if (< pitch 72) ...`) are both just Scheme code, so it's very
flexible. You can handle those things however you like.

One other approach to doing this is a recursion approach straight out of the
functional programming handbook[^little-schemer], just with a temporal twist.
The key idea: start with a list, recurring on the `cdr` (i.e. the tail of the
list) each time until it's empty, then stopping.

So, here's a way of playing a scale---ascending, then descending---then stopping.

```extempore
(define (ascending-descending-scale beat dur plist)
  ;; note the (car plist) since plist is a list, not a number
  (play syn1 (car plist) 80 dur)
  (if (not (null? plist))
      (callback (*metro* (+ beat (* .5 dur))) 'ascending-descending-scale (+ beat dur) dur
                (cdr plist))))

(ascending-descending-scale (*metro* 'get-beat 4) 1/4
                            '(60 62 64 65 67 69 71 72 71 69 67 65 64 62 60))
```

There are a couple of nice variations on this one:

- replace the `(cdr plist)` with `(rotate plist -1)` to make it cycle through
  the pitches, but then go back to the start (have a think about what `rotate`
  does to convince yourself that this works)

- you can re-trigger this temporal recursion several times, either with the same
  `plist`, or even with different `plist`s---since all the temporal callback
  chains will be independent they'll all just run nicely over the top of one
  another, which can lead to some interesting musical "layerings"

    that's not just an idiom, I'm actually thinking of a [specific

## multi-laptop Extempore clock sync

If you're jamming with another Extempore laptop musician, you often want to make
sure your tempos & metronomes sync up. One way to do this is to use the topclock
protocol (the name comes from [TOPLAP](https://toplap.org)). You'll need a
network connection between all the machines---wired is best if you can manage
it, or at least on a private-ish wifi LAN (you'll probably have a bad time
trying to do it over _ANU Secure_).

There's an example in `examples/core/topclock_metro.xtm` which will show you the details.

The alternative (manual) way to sync up two laptops is to:

1. make sure you're both using the same tempo:

   ```extempore
   (*metro* 'set-tempo 140) ;; or whatever tempo you like
   ```

2. both starting "playing time", i.e. something simple which is easy to listen
   to and feel the tempo

3. listening carefully, try and figure out if you're [rushing or
   dragging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ_6VUs2VCk), and then executing the
   appropriate `*metro*` function call:

   ```extempore
   ;; if you're rushing
   (*metro* 'pull)
   
   ;; if you're dragggin
   (*metro* 'push)
   ```

Pros with this approach: no network connection required, and it's usually not
too tricky to get the timing close enough to jam together. Cons: it's pretty
manual (and requires some careful listening, which is a skill that takes time to
master), and it also doesn't help with getting the exact beat clock synced up
(so that you'll still have to be careful that e.g. your 4-beat bars line up, and
you may have to keep fiddling with some offsets to make it all work).
