In the (Australian) Summer of '16/17, '17/18 and '18/19 I ran an [_Internet of
Things_ China Study Tour](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/china-study-tour/) at
the Beijing Institute of Technology. They were good times.

However, the [New Colombo
Plan](https://dfat.gov.au/people-to-people/new-colombo-plan/about/Pages/about.aspx)
grant (which provided the money for us to provide the travel & accommodation
scholarships for the study tour) expired last year---it was only a 3-year thing.
As a result, the BIT trip is not running this year (Summer '19/20). It _might_
happen in future years (if we get more grant funding) but I'm afraid I can't be
certain about that.

If you're interested in "study abroad" opportunities more generally then the
nice folks at [ANU Global
Programs](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/careers-opportunities/global-programs)
are the best people to talk to.
