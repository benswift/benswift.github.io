livecoded visuals (live GLSL shader hacking). We're playing 5:30pm--7:30pm @

The DNA of colour_
exhibition](https://dhg.anu.edu.au/events/ildiko-kovacs-the-dna-of-colour/).

Also on the bill are current & former members of the [ANU Laptop
Ensemble](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/lens/), including Ushini
