In case you missed it, I was interviewed for [an article on the ABC News
website](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-21/live-coding-australia-music-computer-code/11301114)
which came out last weekend entitled _The Australians making music with computer
code_. A nice look at some of the players in the Australian livecoding scene.
