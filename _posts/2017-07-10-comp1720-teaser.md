If you're an ANU student and you want to learn how to make art with code, then
sign up
for
[COMP1720/6720 in semester 2, 2017](http://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/COMP1720).
Taught by me and a bunch of internationally recognised artists (there's a weekly
computational artist guest lecture) it's the best way to scratch the art+code
itch at the ANU.

No previous programming or artistic experience is required: we'll teach you both
things from the ground up, then we'll teach you to put them together.

Here are 5 reasons you should take COMP1720 this year (number 4 will **shock**
you!):

1. the course has been tweaked from last year's version: this year we'll make
   art in the browser (with javascript and the [p5 library](https://p5js.org/))
   
2. the major project theme this year will be ANU Grand Challenges---here's your
   chance to say something about the big problems facing the world
   
3. if you're doing a CS degree but find some of the programming stuff a bit
   difficult, here's a secret: *making art with code is how **I** learned to
   program*. This course is the perfect chance to make sure those fundamentals
   are solid, and will teach you skills you can use in all of your CS courses
   (even the non-arty ones)

4. this year we'll be doing more sound/music stuff than ever before (because, as
   you'll know if you've seen me perform or clicked around this site a bit, I
   love me some code + music)

5. if you're not a computer science student, but you've heard that computers are
   going to eat all of the jobs in the future and you want to get on board, then
   this is a perfect "intro to programming" course, and you'll learn about how
   to communicate through interactive digital media

So head on down to student services and sign up.
