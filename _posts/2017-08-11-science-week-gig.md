I'm playing a livecoding set at the [ACT Science Week launch party
tonight](https://www.scienceweek.net.au/national-science-week-act-launch-future-earth-festival/?search-location-code=2600&search-location-lat=-35.306768&search-location-lng=149.126355&search-location-name=CANBERRA&search-location-type=T&search-location=ACT&search-date-start=Today&search-date-end=All+dates&text=&audience=All+ages&search-topic=&search-events-count=74&search-online-count=30&utm_content=buffer19391&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer).
Sorry about the late notice to anyone who uses this blog to come to my gigs---I
really should set up a newsletter or something. I think there are still a few
tickets left ($5, available from the website linked above).
