I'm playing a livecoding set at the [ACT Science Week launch party
tonight](https://www.scienceweek.net.au/). Sorry about the late notice to anyone
who uses this blog to come to my gigs---I really should set up a newsletter or
something. I think there are still a few tickets left ($5, available from the
website linked above).
