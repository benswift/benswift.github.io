If you [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/benswift) you've seen this
already, but over the last couple of months I've been hard at work on an AI art
installation called Panic. This was a collaboration with [Adrian
Schmidt](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/people/adrian-schmidt/)---I did the
software, he did the hardware (including the cool, 6" diameter _Panic!_ button).

I wrote [an essay on the School of Cybernetics
website](https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/news/2022/11/22/panic-a-serendipity-engine/)
which goes into more detail about how it works and what it all means (I mean,
it's an artwork, so mostly I built it because I could, but some folks wanna know
"what's the practical application of this stuff" so I wrote some words to give
plausible deniability).

Also, Ushini & I did another [livecoding set at the OzCHI 2022
conference](http://www.ozchi.org/2022/creative_4.html). There's no video online
yet, but we did record it (not a clean feed from the desk, but enough to get the
gist) and I'll put the video up on the [livecoding page]({% link livecoding.md
%}) as soon as I can.

Here's a pic to whet your appetite.
