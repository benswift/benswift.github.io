summary: My pitch to be a Reimagine Fellow as part of the current reimagination project in CS/Engineering at the ANU.
---

The [ANU College of Engineering and Computer Science](https://cecs.anu.edu.au)
(CECS) is being _Reimagined_. Don't take my word for it; listen to our fearless
leader [Elanor](https://cecs.anu.edu.au):

{:style="clear:both;"}
{% include slides/youtube.html id="FjlgEZzaL6k" aspect="56.25%" %}

Basically, this [Reimagine project](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/reimagine) is a
_huge_ investment from the ANU for CECS to grow, change, and to skate to where
the puck is going to be in 2050 (technologically, societally, culturally, and
more).

The search is on within CECS to identify **Reimagine Fellows** to champion
various parts of this transformation. This is super-exciting, especially for
interdisciplinary art/design/technology folks (like me). It'd be exciting if it
was happening _anywhere_, but it's particularly exciting that it's happening
where I am and that I might get a voice in shaping exactly what a "reimagined
CECS" looks like.

{:.hl-para}

Elanor, if you're reading, I want to be a Reimagine Fellow ([update 30 Aug 2019:
ðŸ™ŒðŸ¥³ðŸ™Œ]({% link _posts/2019-08-30-Im-a-reimagine-fellow.md %})).
And since the
[EoI](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/staff/project-reimagine-fellows-expression-interest)
asked for "1000 words **in any format you like**", here's mine in the form of an
FAQ[^faq].

[^faq]: At least it's not a haiku. Or a limerick.

## Ben's _Reimagine Fellow_ Application FAQ

### In one sentence, why do you want to be a Reimagine Fellow?

I want to see more art[^art] happening in CECS; and I want to strengthen our
education and research ties to the Schools of Art & Design, Music, and Digital
Humanities.

[^art]:
    Defining "art" is beyond the scope of this blog post, obviously. But I don't
    just mean it in the narrow "high/fine art" sense, although I don't mean it
    in the "all the humanities" sense either. Think making music, drawing
    pictures, writing stories---but with an element of technology in the mix.

### What does that have to do with the Reimagine Project?

> _The role of an artist is to ask questions, not to answer them_ -**Anton
> Chekhov**

As Elanor says in the video above, we don't even know what tomorrow's problems
are yet; so we need problem _finders_, not just problem _solvers_. Art and
artists have a key role to play in this (just ask Chekhov).

### Why are you the best person to do this?

I've made a career (so far) of deploying my technical/CS skills to artistic
ends: in my livecoding (both building
[tools](https://github.com/digego/extempore) and [doing live
gigs]({% link livecoding.md %})), in starting the [ANU Laptop
Ensemble](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/lens/),
in teaching our first-year art+code course
[COMP1720](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/), etc.

Along the way I've built strong networks in these areas across the ANU campus
and in the wider community, and I've always said that I was keen to engage with
them more deeply---this is my chance.

### So you're just trying to score a grant to go off and do your own weird art thing?

Absolutely not. Being a Reimagine Fellow isn't about doing something by
yourself---it's way too big a project for that. It's about weaving something
into the whole College[^dna], so that by 2050 it affects the way _everyone_
thinks.

[^dna]:
    You could even say "weaving it into the College's DNA". But that'd be dumb.
    Institutions don't have DNA... except maybe
    [RSB](https://biology.anu.edu.au).

### What might this look like, concretely?

The Reimagine Project is [big, hairy, and
audacious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal), so it's
difficult to sketch out a detailed description or org chart. However, here are a
few ideas about what it might look like.

#### In the short term...

- a CECS-supported "Reimagine residency" (starting asap!) to support artists to
  get involved and help us figure out what a Reimagined CECS looks like

- a new code/creativity/culture major (at both undergraduate and masters level)
  where students take courses from within CECS, the [ANU School of Art &
  Design](http://soad.cass.anu.edu.au), and the [ANU School of
  Music](https://music.anu.edu.au)

- new courses within CECS on e.g. algorithmic music composition, creative
  making, AI/Deep Learning Art, subversive computing/[designing for
  evil](https://www.washington.edu/news/2018/05/21/designed-for-evil/)[^genevieve]

- more PhD students doing practice-led research on interdisciplinary
  art/CS/engineering projects

- encouraging **all** CECS academics to engage with their peers and the wider
  world by _making and exhibiting beautiful/interesting/challenging things_, not
  just through journal papers

[^genevieve]: I'd love to get [Genevieve](https://twitter.com/feraldata) to write & teach that one.

#### In the medium/long term...

- a centre of excellence for digital arts/music/multimedia research, teaching
  and creative practice (co-hosted by CECS and the [College of Arts & Social
  Sciences](http://cass.anu.edu.au))

- a thoroughly non-traditional project-based "creative tech" masters program,
  with no classes, no heirarchies, just a bunch of brilliant students set loose
  with duct tape, gaming GPUs, a giant bag of sensors & actuators, soldering
  irons, a 3D printer, oh my. (Geoff Hinchcliffe and I have discussed
  this---we're both thrilled and terrified at the prospect. And I love what the
  [3AI](https://3ainstitute.cecs.anu.edu.au/#apply) master's program is shaping
  up to be, and am keen to be a part of it.)

- incorporating into every course[^every-course] the option to create and submit
  a "creative work" to demonstrate attainment of the learning outcomes (ðŸ¤”
  really Ben?)

[^every-course]:
    I kindof want to wriggle out and say _most courses_, but I also really want
    to see what an artistic submission in lieu of a final exam looks like for
    [COMP3600](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp3600/).

I also look forward to having the time to think through what a deeply artistic
CECS looks like. I'm sure that in collaboration with the other Reimagine Fellows
and the rest of the design team we can come up even more ideas.

### How does this further the broader goals of the Reimagine Project...

#### ...in research?

Artists have always been at the vanguard of building new things (or seeing/using
old things in new ways). If an artist has an idea in their head for what they
want to create, but the tools to realise it don't exist yet, that artist is
_intrinsically_ motivated to figure out how to make it happen.

I also want to be clear that my pitch here isn't to view the arts as a technical
problem that needs to be _solved_ by engineers and computer scientists: "hey
artists, thanks for the last few thousand years, we'll take it from here". We've
already got too much technochauvinism in tech. Instead, the pitch is that a
newly-Reimagined CECS can _include_ artists in shaping what the computer
scientists and engineers of 2050 look like, so that it's _not_ an "us and them".

Some of the top research institutions in the world are asking real questions in
the fields of creative technology, digital art, music and design: have a look at
[the list below](#where-in-the-world-is-this-already-happening).

#### ...in education?

That Chekhov quote above really nails it. For some students, being asked to make
something creative/artistic is what it takes to flick the switch to go beyond
the "what boxes do I need to tick for me to get a P/CR/D/HD" mindset to actually
asking the right questions. I see this sometimes in
[COMP1720](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/), and it's one of the most
enjoyable things about teaching that course.

More broadly, I want to see more dreamers, doodlers and "creatives"[^creatives]
study engineering or CS at uni. Too often they feel like they have to choose
between "pursuing the dream" or selling out and studying something boring &
pragmatic, and I fear that we (CECS) miss out on some _brilliant_ students
because of this. I want these students to know that they can pursue their
creative dreams, and in doing so they'll be doing top-class
engineering/CS/design work.

[^creatives]:
    Although I reject the Romantic notion that "creatives" are some sort of
    rarefied "other", conduits to some deep wellspring of hidden creative mojo
    from the other side. We're all just humans, constructing and engaging in
    cultural practices with this stuff, building on what went before.

#### ...in outreach?

Because of my [livecoding]({% link livecoding.md %}) I get
asked to do outreach stuff all the time (you're welcome, CECS marketing team
ðŸ˜‰). I know why I get asked: DJing with code is so _different_, it's a great
hook for engaging folks who might not have thought that combining code & musical
creativity in that way was possible.

#### ...in culture?

The Reimagine Project isn't just about doing the same things under a different
org-chart. It's about changing the culture of Engineering & Computing research
and practice. While the stereotypes about nerdy engineers and computer types
isn't necessarily fair in my experience, there's no smoke without a fire, and
there _are_ some things we need to do better. Incorporating the arts and
creative expression deep within our education, research and outreach work will
change the way we communicate with the outside world, but it'll also change the
sorts of people we attract, and welcoming new perspectives into CECS is another
way we can enact cultural change.

### Isn't this treading on the toes of the School of Art & Design (and the School of Music, and ...)?

No---in fact we need to work with our colleagues in those places to make this
stuff happen. I already co-supervise PhD students with
[Mitchell](https://twitter.com/mtchl) & [Geoff](https://twitter.com/gravitron)
from the School or Art & Design, and [Terhi](https://twitter.com/tmtn) from the
Centre for Digital Humanities Research, and I run the ANU Laptop Ensemble with
[Alec](https://twitter.com/huntercomposer) from the School of Music. And I want
to see _more_ of this type of cross-supervision across these parts of campus.

Actually, this "treading on toes" question looms over the whole Reimagine
Project. I think the best way forward is to partner with the other parts of
campus to bring their expertise and smoosh it together with ours.

Concretely, that means:

- sending CECS coursework students to take courses in other parts of campus (as
  part of majors/minors/electives, etc.) as well as the other way around
- co-employing academics across Colleges in joint positions
- increasing our to participation in the ANU's interdisciplinary HDR programs
  like [ICCR](http://rsha.cass.anu.edu.au/students/future/iccr)

### Where in the world is this already happening? {#where-in-the-world-is-this-already-happening}

### Has the ANU ever had anything like this before?

Sure, for example [this](http://www.avatar.com.au/courses/acat/), and it was
amazing. The story about why ACAT is no longer around is long, and I've only
really ever heard it second/third-hand, and I'm not proposing to resurrect ACAT
as part of the Reimagine Project. But it's important to know one's history.

### Sounds like a huge job, Ben---how are you going to manage it?

Not on my own, that's for sure. Only by building up our capacity in these areas.
As an example, [Dr. Charles Martin](https://twitter.com/cpmpercussion) is just
about to start as a Lecturer in RSCS, and he's a computer musician (apps and ML
for group musical improvisation). The campus also has many other
interdisciplinary artists who have been hiding their lights under bushels---I
want to give them a banner to rally to.

We need to think big, and I look forward to a day where there's a long list of
academic staff & PhD students exploring new avenues for technologically and
culturally sophisticated artistic practice within CECS and the broader ANU
campus. That's what I want us to be famous for.

### Do you really get asked these questions _frequently_, Ben?

No.

### So is it really fair to call it an *F*AQ?

Probably not. Sorry.
