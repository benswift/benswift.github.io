[Stafford Beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer) tells a joke about
defining cybernetics in [an address he gave at the University of
Valladolid](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/03684920210417283/):

> ...it concerns three men who are about to be executed. The prison governor
> calls them to his office, and explains that each will be granted a last
> request. The first one confesses that he has led a sinful life, and would like
> to see a priest. The governor says he thinks he can arrange that. And the
> second man? The second man explains that he is a professor of cybernetics. His
> last request is to deliver a final and definitive answer to the question: what
> is cybernetics? The governor accedes to this request also. And the third man?
> Well, he is a doctoral student of the professor---his request is to be
> executed second.
  
It's a great joke, partially because it communicates a deep truth. But one way
to define cybernetic systems is as systems with (i) a goal/purpose and (ii) a
mechanism for steering towards[^towards] said goal. In some cases there's still
a defined end goal, where upon attaining said goal victory is declared and the
system is shuts up shop. However in many cases what's desirable is
[homeostasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis), or a system which can
keep itself "in its happy place" and is resistant to peturbations.

[^towards]:
    Such goals can also be stated negatively, e.g. the goal of avoiding pain. So
    towards/away from are equally valid goals.

There are lots of potential illustrations of this, but one that many of my
cybernetic forebears liked is the one of a ship's captain using the stars (or a
lighthouse) to navigate. It's not the particular position of the tiller at any
one time that's important, is the way that the captain watches the stars and
moves the tiller in response (as the ship is affected by currents & winds). If
the ship's bow isn't pointing at the star, then adjust the tiller in the
opposite direction until it does. If you keep up that simple procedure, you'll
get there in the end (and with your ship in one piece). It's the captian's
continued monitoring of the difference between the goal (as indicated by the
star) and the current state (as indicated by the where the bow is pointing)
which matters, and once you know how to respond to that difference (by steering
in the opposite direction of that difference) then you've got a reliable (and
simple) procedure for successful sailing.

Such systems don't work by planning out a complex, all-encompassing list of
actions to take and then mindlessly following them, but through a process
involving _feedback_: doing a thing, looking/listening/sensing what happened,
comparing the new state of the world with the goals, and then doing a thing...
and so on.

If that definition sounds a bit unremarkable or
all-encompassing, you're not the first person to notice that---cybernetics isn't
shy about claiming things as within its purview.

Futures/futuring---and here I mean futuring/to future in the verb sense (see
[Smith and Ashby](https://www.howtofuture.com) for an practical guide or
[Powers](https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=p084690) for a more critical
history and review)---seems like the sort of thing which cybernetics has
something to say about. Even the more mundane acts of management and oversight:
strategy, tactics, contingency planning---when done well they all involve
articulating goals and thinking about ways to bring them about. There's clearly
an echo of the "steering systems" thing here, but what does that mean in practice?

## Practical cybernetic futuring?

The thing about the future is that it's hard to visualise the unexpected, and
humans aren't great at predicting the future. It's a misconception about
futuring (not a misconception of expert practitioners, but one which they
encounter when explaining what they do to others) that it's about predicting the
future. It's not, in fact it's about making the future _less_ certain---which is
where the steering/feedback ideas from cybernetics can help us understand
things.

Each future scenario you can imagine (regardless of where it falls in the space
of
[possible/probable/preferrable](https://thevoroscope.com/2017/02/24/the-futures-cone-use-and-history/)
futures) is a way of projecting a "goal state". Said goal state doesn't have to
be desirable---many potential futures aren't---but it gives a concrete thing
against which to compare your current state (and therefore to inform current
decisionmaking). The solution, then, is to consider _lots_ of different future
states, sort through them to find ones you want to steer towards (or avoid), and
then to look through the steering decisions you'd take in response.

And, just like a ship drifts on the currents (in fact _much_ more so) our
orientation to any particular future is constantly changing as we & others act
in the present. So the solution is to constantly re-examine our orientation
towards these multiple futures and reorient ourselves as a result. That's the
cybernetic "steering" process applied to futuring. Cybernetics doesn't provide a
"once you measure & model all the things you can predict the future" silver
bullet ([although it's not like some folks haven't
tried](https://eujournalfuturesresearch.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s40309-013-0029-y)),
but rather it's a commitment to using a simple "look-decide-act" feedback loop
to keep the system on track.

[How William Gibson Coined "Cyberspace"](https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/08/26/how-william-gibson-coined-cyberspace/)

[Cybernetics: The Center of Science's
Future](https://www.pangaro.com/cybernetics-the-center-of-sciences-future.html)
as Paul Pangarro told _The Philosophical Society of Washington_ in 1991.

What is the derivation of the word? "Cyber" is from the Greek word for
navigator. Norbert Wiener coined "cybernetics" around 1948 to denote the study
of "teleological mechanisms." [2007 NYT Sunday Magazine article _Back From the
Future: Questions for William
Gibson_](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/magazine/19wwln-q4-t.html)

## Appendix: Garran Oration

If you read through [Genevieve Bell's Garran
Oration](https://www.ipaa.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Garran-Oration-2021.pdf)
(mentioned above), she notes

> In particular, there are three threads that have revealed themselves and that
> I want to share with you. I tend to think of them as hallmarks of
> organisations that will build successful systems, cybernetic systems.

These are:

1. iterative communications
2. productive discomfort
3. strength & grace

I'm still thinking through how the "rubber hits the road" when it comes to these
hallmarks as applied to the practice of cybernetic futuring.
