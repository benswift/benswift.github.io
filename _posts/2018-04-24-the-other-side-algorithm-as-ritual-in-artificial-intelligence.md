Tomorrow morning (Wed April 25, 9am Montr√©al time) Kieran Browne and I are
performing an Artificial Intelligence divination ritual as part of the _alt.chi_
session [Scary, Sporty, Ginger and
Posh](https://chi2018.acm.org/technical-program/?sessionId=-L6Uzypel81JpsiUKYQ2&publicationId=-L7SB7rZwtlVgobKgWoH).

This is not a talk _about_ the ritual; we will be performing the ritual **live**
at CHI, using an analog computing apparatus to communicate with an artificial
intelligence to divine the answers to our questions.

The ritual will **start on time at 9am** in [room
514B](https://chi2018.acm.org/technical-program/?maps=true)---it's a small room,
so please come a touch early to make sure you don't miss out on a seat.

See [Kieran's blog](https://kieranbrowne.com/works/the-other-side/) for more
details about tomorrow's ritual, and read the [paper]({% link
assets/documents/preprints/browne_swift_2018_the_other_side.pdf %}) for the full
story.
