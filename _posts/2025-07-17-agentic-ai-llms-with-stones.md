Agentic AI (as concieved and talked about in this present moment) is about
connecting LLMs---"pure" input/output text sausage machines---to the world,
which has the (perhaps surprising) knock-on effect that LLMs can now run/iterate
without intervention for much longer. To be clear: humans were always a) able to
do things in the environment, and b) the bottleneck (LLMs have to wait on them).
But by gaining the former capability, agentic AI removes the latter bottleneck.
