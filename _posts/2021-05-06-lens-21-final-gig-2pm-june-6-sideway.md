If you're a fan of _LENS_, the ANU Laptop Ensemble, then you're welcome to come
to the S1 2021 end-of-semester gig. Here are the details

- **Date**: Sunday June 6
- **Time**: Doors at 2pm, warm-up act (me) to start at 2:30pm, LENS members on from 3pm, finish at 6pm
- **Venue**: [sideway music bar](https://sidewaybc.com)

More details (including a full performer schedule) to come, but mark it in your
diaries. There's also a [FB
event](https://www.facebook.com/events/831223320837700) if that's your jam.

If you want to get psyched, have a look at what the LENS '21 cohort have been up
to with their [weekly Audiovisual Diary submissions on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcVQ4-5YvlE&list=PLKm3iGh1D7Mvm9byMk4mP40xVxYAbSUIn).
