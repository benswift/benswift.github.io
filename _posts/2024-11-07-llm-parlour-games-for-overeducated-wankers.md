title: LLM Parlour Games for Overeducated Wankers
tags: teaching ai

## Abstract

In this interactive design session participants will design and prototype their
own language-model-based parlour game. We'll think critically about what
language models are (and aren't) and what they're good for (and rubbish at).
You'll interact with other humans and design systems with goals and guardrails,
and think about what it means to give input to (and understand output from) LLMs
and genAI systems.

Prerequisites: ability to lounge around and use big words to impress your
friends in games of no stakes whatsoever. Self-satisfied smugness about said
loquaciousness is helpful but not essential.

## thesis statement

> the killer app for genAI is parlour games for overeducated wankers
>
> this is a demographic I know well, because I am one

- parlour: co-located humans. bored. night outside, drinks inside... and so

- games: keen to entertain one another

- for overeducated: word games, word play, show off

- wankers: (literally) self-indulgent. not about a bigger goal, or doing good in
  the world

## some examples

- 20 questions
- fictionary
- minister's cat
- you've probably got your own favourites

## mechanics of a parlour game

(in general)

```basic
10 one or more player(s) says something
20 one or more player(s) say something in response
30 goto 20
```

## LLMs could play

prompt -> response

## 20 questions example

```
I'm thinking of an object. Ask me a yes/no question about the object and I'll give you an answer.
```

```
If the object in question is $OBJECT, what is the answer to the yes/no question "$QUESTION?"
```

## today's structure

- play 20qs (initially raw-dog, then with AIs)
- discuss the mechanics & gameplay
- design a new LLM-based parlour game (or just modify an existing one)

## remember

There's no higher purpose here. Parlour games for overeducated wankers.
