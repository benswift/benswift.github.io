For bonus points, which of them _also_ recognise the "other" subcommand but it
does something different? For even more bonus points, when does that "other"
option do something unwanted/destructive/irreversible (assuming that all you
want to do is update that dependency to the latest version)?

Look, I'm not at all saying that you should just go and blindly
`update`/`upgrade` all of the things---that's clearly a bad idea. But it still
takes me a non-zero amount of time as I switch between languages/tools to sit
and think "ok, for this project do I want to `update` or `upgrade`"? And that
makes me sad.

If there's a deep, principled (or even a shallow, pragmatic) reason to pick one
or the other then we should observe it, and do it _consistently_. Even if
there's not, we should toss a coin and be consistent anyway.

If any of the above commands are incorrect, or if there's a better way, then
