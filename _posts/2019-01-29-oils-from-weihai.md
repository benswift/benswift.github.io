One of my academic responsibilities is teaching our ANU Computer Science
programs into our various partner institutions overseas. One of these partner
institutions is [Shandong University
WeiHai](https://en.wh.sdu.edu.cn/enDefault.html) (SDUW).

On my trip to SDUW in May 2016, I was walking across the campus one bright
spring morning when I was stopped by a professor from the SDUW School of Art.
Through his limited English and my much more limited Mandarin, he told me that
he wanted me to sit for a portrait session for his first-year painting class.

After a marathon 4hr sitting[^tired], here's what the students came up with. As
a bonus, I got to choose my favourite one and bring it home---can you guess
which one I chose?

It's now hanging on my wall at home, creepily looking down at my family and our
guests. **I love it**.

[^tired]:
    that's why I look so sullen---I smiled no-stop for the first hour (when they
    were painting the background) but by the time they were putting on the
    facial details 3hrs in I was _way_ too tired to keep my smile up üòä
