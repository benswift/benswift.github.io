title: Reimagine Fellowship UK trip report
tags: reimagine
---

I was lucky enough to be able to spend most of February in the UK on a research
visit as part of my [Reimagine Fellowship]({% link
_posts/2019-08-30-Im-a-reimagine-fellow.md %})---designing & delivering a
"creative" coding extension course for ACT students in year 11 & 12.

It was a great trip, and has answered some of the questions that I had ahead of
time, and more importantly has helped me pose better questions in the future. A
few trip highlights:

- the International Conference on Live Coding (ICLC '20) was super-fun,
  [performing at the conference Algorave]({% link
  _livecoding/2020-02-07-iclc-20.md %}) was a nice chance to show off some of
  the more recent work in [Extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore),
  being invited to run an [Extempore
  workshop](https://iclc.toplap.org/2020/schedule.html) was an important chance
  to road test some of the "creative coding teaching materials" I'll be rolling
  out next year through the [c/c/c studio creative code outreach program]({%

- hanging out with [Sam Aaron](https://twitter.com/samaaron) (of [Sonic
  Pi](http://sonic-pi.net) fame) to discuss ways to use creative coding as a
  diverse & inclusive pathway into computing, the architecture of livecoding
  languages/environments, and again [making some
  music](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/551005336)

- meeting with [Simon Peyton
  Jones](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/simonpj/) at [MSR
  Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/)
  to see how the grassroots [Computing at
  School](https://www.computingatschool.org.uk) (CAS) organisation (of which
  he's the chair) works to encourage, support and equip teachers of computing
  through a Community of Professional Practice, and to think about how we could
  provide similar support to teachers in the ACT (and Australia), especially in
  the context of providing creative code classroom resources & professional
  development opportunities

- Visiting Quintin Cutts and the [Centre for Computing Science
  Education](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/cseducation/)
  at Glasgow University to [present]({% link _talks/designing-the-ccc-studio.md
  %}) & workshop ideas for the c/c/c studio outreach course, think strategically
  about building up our (ANU RSCS's) capability in CS education research and
  partnering with them on improving the learning experience for all our existing
  students, and also attracting new and diverse students who might not consider
  studying CS at uni

- climbing [Dumgoyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumgoyne) in a whiteout,
  emerging at the top just as the sun broke through the clouds to reveal a
  glorious view of the countryside, then falling on my arse on the way down and
  having to put my trousers in the dryer the night before flying out (as shown
  in the picture)

All of these folks will be important collaborators going forward as we put the
creative code curriculum together (next deadline: documents for the [ACT
BSSS](http://www.bsss.act.edu.au) for accreditaion, due at the end of March). In
addition, I'm speaking next week at the National Future Schools festival (with
[Bruce Fuda](https://aca.edu.au/about/)) on [Teaching Code with Music and
Teaching Music with
Code](https://www.terrapinn.com/exhibition/national-future-schools/speaker-ben-SWIFT.stm),
so if you're in attendance you should come along and say hi.
